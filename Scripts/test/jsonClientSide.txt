{"ask_nature_product":{"title":"Air-trapping coating for ships, submarines","description":"Coating to reduce drag, increase bouyancy","explanation":"Researchers from the Nanoprobe Laboratory for Bio- and Nanotechnology and Biomimetics at Ohio State University are developing a biomimetic coating for use on ships and submersible aquatic vehicles. The purpose of their research is to mimic the air trapping ability of the water fern Salvinia molesta, an aquatic plant that traps air on the surface of its leaves. The research team has demonstrated microfabrication techniques that can be applied in various industries. These techniques can be used to produce materials that reduce drag in water by using a layer of air to repel surrounding water.A micropattern with comparable dimensions to the water fern hairs is created in the lab. The micropattern is treated with a hydrophobic (water-repelling) coating that is then stripped away to produce a new microstructure that is hydrophobic everywhere except on its tips. This development process mimics the water fern hairs by exhibiting a hydrophobic base and hydrophilic (water-attracting) tip. While it may seem counterintuitive to have a surface that attracts water while building underwater machinery, it is actually beneficial because it holds the water at a consistent distance from the material's surface. This results in an even surface that does not allow the water to interact with the larger surface area in between the microstructures. This layer of water also locks in air between the microstructures, providing buoyancy for objects in and under the water.","challenges_solved":"\"Air-retaining surfaces are of technological interest due to their ability to reduce drag when used for fluid transport, ship coatings and other submersible industrial products in which drag is a concern. Superhydrophobic surfaces have been utilized to obtain the desired air film for the previously stated applications, however the effect called 'giant liquid slip' has been shown to deteriorate the presence of such air films in a matter of minutes. Therefore, S. molesta’s unique ability to pin water and trap air is of importance in order to increase the durability and lifetime of air pocket formation for drag reduction in industrial use\" (Hunt and Bushan 2011: 187).","differences_from_existing_products":"Decreasing drag and increasing bouyancy of ships or submarines increases the efficiency of these vessels, reducing the amount of fuel required to power them.","text_keywords":"biomimicry, design, ask nature, biomimesis, function, janine benyus, biomimetics, architecture, biology, innovation, design, asknature","location":"http://www.asknature.org/product/9db08f87c7bb21d1cd485fb33f64ca50","main_images":[{"location":"http://www.asknature.org/images/uploads/product/9db08f87c7bb21d1cd485fb33f64ca50/wateronhairs.jpg.492x0_q85_cropsmart.jpg","mm_name":"image","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"location":"http://www.asknature.org/images/uploads/product/9db08f87c7bb21d1cd485fb33f64ca50/wateronhairs.jpg.492x0_q85_cropsmart.jpg","mm_name":"image","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"}],"inspiring_strategies":[{"title":"Leaf structure retains air layer underwater: water fern","location":"http://www.asknature.org/strategy/29db109b16deb3f57e6b99388b1d9884","description":"Coating to reduce drag, increase bouyancy","mm_name":"ask_nature_strategy","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"}],"favicon":{"location":"http://www.asknature.org/favicon.ico","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","mm_name":"image"},"download_status":"DOWNLOAD_DONE","mm_name":"ask_nature_product"}}

I have watched Megarhyssa ichneumon wasps drill through several centimetres of solid elm in order to parasitize the woodboring larvae of horntail wasps that feed deep inside dead trees. The parasite appears to detect the presence of horntails by smelling with its antennae and perhaps by feeling the larvae's vibrations in the wood. The ovipositor of Megarhyssa is longer than the wasp itself--it measures almost 10 centimetres--and is highly flexible.

{"ask_nature_strategy":{"title":"Mineral crystals enhance rasping power: chitons","description":"The radular ribbons with which chitons scrape algae from rocks have enhanced rasping power because they contain layers of magnetite crystals within a chitin matrix.","summary":"\"Many invertebrates use crystals of metal salts to harden their cutting, rasping, and grinding equipment. (Metal salts aren't, of course, metallic, in the mechanical or metallurgical sense, so they're not examples of metallic materials in nature.) For instance, the radular ribbons with which chitons (a group of mollusks) scrape algae from rocks contain layers of iron, as magnetite (Fe3O4), within a chitin (not chiton) matrix (van der Wal et al. 1989).\" (Vogel 2003:333)\"The major lateral teeth of the chiton Acanthopleura echinata are composite structures composed of three distinct mineral zones: a posterior layer of magnetite; a thin band of lepidocrocite just anterior to this; and apatite throughout the core and anterior regions of the cusp. Biomineralization in these teeth is a matrix-mediated process, in which the minerals are deposited around fibers, with the different biominerals described as occupying architecturally discrete compartments. In this study, a range of scanning electron microscopes was utilized to undertake a detailed in situ investigation of the fine structure of the major lateral teeth. The arrangement of the organic and biomineral components of the tooth is similar throughout the three zones, having no discrete borders between them, and with crystallites of each mineral phase extending into the adjacent mineral zone. Along the posterior surface of the tooth, the organic fibers are arranged in a series of fine parallel lines, but just within the periphery their appearance takes on a fish scale-like pattern, reflective of the cross section of a series of units that are overlaid, and offset from each other, in adjacent rows. The units are approximately 2 m wide and 0.6 m thick and comprise biomineral plates separated by organic fibers. Two types of subunits make up each 'fish scale': one is elongate and curved and forms a trough, in which the other, rod-like unit, is nestled. Adjacent rod and trough units are aligned into large sheets that define the fracture plane of the tooth. The alignment of the plates of rod-trough units is complex and exhibits extreme spatial variation within the tooth cusp. Close to the posterior surface the plates are essentially horizontal and lie in a lateromedial plane, while anteriorly they are almost vertical and lie in the posteroanterior plane. An understanding of the fine structure of the mineralized teeth of chitons, and of the relationship between the organic and mineral components, provides a new insight into biomineralization mechanisms and controls.\" (Wealthall et al. 2005:165)","application_ideas":"Application Ideas: Composite tools or machines for cutting (including on the nano- or micro-scales), more durable agricultural tools and implements.","interested_indstrial_sectors":"Industrial Sector(s) interested in this strategy: Nanotechnology, manufacturing, agriculture","text_keywords":"biomimicry, design, ask nature, biomimesis, function, janine benyus, biomimetics, architecture, biology, innovation, design, asknature","location":"http://www.asknature.org/strategy/b91cc7c16934434bb7c01ecbd8ad286c","main_images":[{"location":"http://www.asknature.org/images/uploads/strategy/b91cc7c16934434bb7c01ecbd8ad286c/28f00b97764d41c421fbf7e237218666.jpg","mm_name":"image","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"}],"inspiring_organism":{"scientific_name":"Acanthopleura","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","mm_name":"ask_nature_organism"},"expert":{"group":"Division of Science and Engineering","name":"David J.

Tomato water has nothing to hide from you except the depth of its flavor. \n                 \n                Remove these ads by\n          Signing UpStep 1: What You'll Need\n    if (typeof notesArray === \"undefined\")\n      window.notesArray = {};\n  \n- Ripe tomatoes (the riper they are, the better the flavor)\n- 3 layers or so of cheesecloth (or a thin and clean dish towel)\n- Large bowl/spoon/strainer\n- Pinch of salt\n* Aromatics (optional, but tasty)\n\nAnd of course, you'll need some time. \n\n\nStep 2: The Prep Step\n    if (typeof notesArray === \"undefined\")\n      window.notesArray = {};\n  <img class=\"photoset-photo\" alt=\"100_0231_1.JPG\" src=\"http://cdn.instructables.com/FGI/XDWW/H1EMHXZJ/FGIXDWWH1EMHXZJ.LARGE.jpg\" style=\"width:224px;\" /><img class=\"photoset-photo\" alt=\"100_0233_1.JPG\" src=\"http://cdn.instructables.com/F4N/BLGH/H1G700RU/F4NBLGHH1G700RU.MEDIUM.jpg\" style=\"width:365px;\" />\nSome recipes call for cooking your tomatoes and skinning them before this step, but for a cocktail or fresh soup base, I'd prefer the bright taste of raw/fresh tomatoes. If you'd prefer a deeper flavor for pasta or a richer dish, feel free to chop your tomatoes up and stew them until they turn a rich red color before proceeding. \n\n- Chop your tomatoes up. \nI suggest chopping them into a medium sized dice just for ease of processing, but it's up to you and your blender strength.\n\n- Add pinch of salt to taste, along with aromatics.\nNow would be the time to add lemongrass, pepper, garlic, lemon juice. Be creative here. I added a habanero for some spice.  \n\n- Add to your blender and blend!\nWe're looking for a puree consistency here, so it's pretty error-proof. \n\n\n« PreviousNext »View All Steps\n     \n\n    \n    <!--jqfx-->\n    <li class=\"ibleVersion\">\n        <div class=\"versionDetails\">\n\t    <span class=\"versionNumber\">\n\t        #<< versionNumber >>\n\t    </span>\n\t    <span class=\"versionLastSaved\">\n\t        saved <span class=\"strong\"><< timeElapsed >></span>\n\t    </span>\n\t    <span class=\"versionDateSaved\">(<< dateSaved >>)</span>\n\t</div>\n\t<div class=\"versionOptions\">\n\t    <a class=\"btn pull-right revertToVersion\"><< revertBtnTxt >></a>\n\t    <a class=\"btn pull-right showVersionPreview\"><< trans.PreviewVersion >></a>\n\t</div>\n    </li>\n\n\n<!--jqfx-->\n    <div id=\"ibleHistory\">\n        <h2>Version History</h2>\n\t<ul id=\"ibleVersions\">\n\t</ul>\n    </div>\n\n\n<!--jqfix-->\n    <div id=\"StepWrapperInternal\">\n        <div id=\"StepTrayContainer\">\n            <div id=\"stepListContainers\">\n                <!-- StepDetailView Manages this content -->\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <a id=\"StepDetailLeftButton\" href=\"#\"></a>\n    <a id=\"StepDetailRightButton\" href=\"#\"></a>\n\n\n<!--jqfix-->\n    <div class=\"stepDetailBox\">\n        <div class=\"imageTray\"></div>\n        <div class=\"TitleBodyBox\">\n            <div class=\"stepTitleWrapper\">\n                <input type=\"text\" class=\"stepTitleInput\" value=\"<< title >>\" placeholder=\"<< StepDecoratorText >> << trans.TypeTitlePrompt >>\"></input>\n            </div>\n            <br />\n            <br />\n\n            <div class=\"ck_wrapper\">\n                <textarea class=\"textEditor\" id=\"editor-<< unid >>\"><< body >></textarea>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n<!--jqfix-->\n    <ul id=\"InstructableVisible\">\n\n    </ul>\n\n\n<!--jqfix-->\n    <!-- 'li' container added in backbone view -->\n    <div class=\"DropAboveStepBar DropAsStepSibling\"><div class=\"dropHereMessage\"><< trans.DropAsNewStep >></div></div>\n    <div class=\" InstructableStep DropAsChild\">\n        <div class=\"wrapStepContent\">   <!-- this div must remain style-less and on its own.

He also practices Gun Kata.","mm_name":"tvtrope_example","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Saiyuki","description":"Genjyo Sanzo from Saiyuki is definitely The Trick Shot, being able to  shoot a seed implanted next to Gojyo's heart by Chin Yiso without hitting the heart. In Reload, he also managed to hit  Ukoku with a pistol 3 times the size of his weapon of choice...which he had never fired before, not even once...while suffering from multiple broken bones.\n Said pistol had belonged to another Gunslinger in the series, Gatto Nenehawk, who was a The Vaporizer and used HUGE twin pistols.","mm_name":"tvtrope_example","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Spike Spiegel","description":"Spike Spiegel borrows elements from The Woo and The Quick Draw. Mad Pierrot is The Vaporizer.","mm_name":"tvtrope_example","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Noir","description":"Noir; Kirika has a near-mystical gift for firearms, accurately shooting without looking or while performing leaps, rarely if ever missing; she is explicitly The Trick Shot. As one fan review put it, \"Kirika isn't a ninja, she's a witch.\"","mm_name":"tvtrope_example","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Madlax","description":"The title character of Madlax also fits under The Trick Shot, though she ventures into Gun Kata territory (and thus The Quick Draw) during the final episodes.","mm_name":"tvtrope_example","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Hellsing","description":"Hellsing:\n Integra Hellsing is a skilled markswoman as well as wielding a sword. Heinkel Wolf also Duel Wields pistols. Seras Victoria and (to a slightly lesser extent) Rip van Winkle qualify more as Small Girl, Big Gun.\n Seras Victoria, meanwhile, is a solid Vaporizer. The Harkonnen (her Weapon of Choice) weighs well over 100 pounds, and can blow up an airship. And let's not talk about her wielding Guns Akimbo flak artilleries...","mm_name":"tvtrope_example","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Samurai Gun","description":"Samurai Gun, naturally, makes heavy use of this trope in its Steam Punk Historical Japan setting. The main character, Ichimatsu, and by extent the other Samurai Guns, are a combination of The Trick Shot and The Woo. Vaporizers show up in several episodes of the anime, including a minigun-toting Implacable Man who is only fighting because it's the only way to keep up the supply of medicine he needs to keep his sick mother alive. The main member of the Anti-Samurai Gun Unit (in the anime, at least) is actually a blend of several types; his primary weapon is a Steam Punk Uzi, but he has the same bullet-dodging training as a Samurai Gun and once proves accurate enough to shoot his opponent's bullet out of the air.","mm_name":"tvtrope_example","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Trigun","description":"Vash from MangaTrigun embodies Trick Shot, The Woo, and The Quick Draw, as he tries to avoid gunplay whenever he can, but when he gets into it, nothing can beat him. His traveling partner Nicolas Wolfwood completes the set as the embodiment of The Vaporizer (with some Woo thrown in), complete with a combination rocket launcher/machine gun/shotgun/pistol rack in the shape of a cross.\n The Bernardelli girls: Meryl Stryfe, despite packing 50 derringers under her cape, is shown to be a Trick Shot artist, able to aim accurately on the run. Milly Thompson (who normally carries her huge Stungun under her cape) would be a Vaporizer if not for the fact her weapon is less-lethal.","mm_name":"tvtrope_example","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Black Lagoon","description":"Black Lagoon is an anime with two Gun Fu experts who use two pistols at close quarters as well as a huge number of gunmen (and women). One of those totes around a minigun...\n More specifically, Balalaika is The Trick Shot, Roberta and Gretel are Vaporizers, and Revy is The Woo.\n Eda, who we haven't seen fight much, appears to be a Quick Draw artist. For evidence, in the episode Calm Down, Two men, she's a faster draw than Revy, though not by much. That itself should be noteworthy, considering Revy's considerable skill.\n And everyone leaves out poor Mr. Chang, who is a surgeon with the more precise types.","mm_name":"tvtrope_example","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Gunsmith Cats","description":"Rally Vincent from Gunsmith Cats is most definitely a Trick Shot. More bizarre tricks with a pistol than you can shake a stick at.","mm_name":"tvtrope_example","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Grenadier","description":"Rushuna Tendo from Grenadier also combines Trick Shot and The Woo into a uniquely anime gun-style, and at one point engages in a full-scale Gun Kata duel with a rival in the final episode.\n Rushuna also covers The Quick Draw. While wielding one six-shooter, she has outshot a multi-barreled machine gun by not only shooting the bullets out of the air but hitting them so precisely they then blocked entire chains of other bullets.","mm_name":"tvtrope_example","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Gunslinger Girl","description":"All of the main characters from Gunslinger Girl.","mm_name":"tvtrope_example","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"guns","description":"While her guns are very small, Natsuki from Mai-HiME is definitely a Vaporizer (since her CHILD can fire missiles and incredibly powerful beams of ice.) Her Mai-Otome counterpart gets a personal BFG.","mm_name":"tvtrope_example","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Outlaw Star","description":"Depending on the weapon he's using, Gene Starwind of Outlaw Star alternates between Trick Shot (pistols), or The Vaporizer (machine guns or rocket launchers)","mm_name":"tvtrope_example","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"One Piece","description":"Usopp in One Piece somehow manages to be a Trick Shot without ever actually using a firearm (at least not one using traditional chemical propulsion). Apparently, he inherits it from his father, who, while we never see being engaged in any particularly amazing examples, brags about being a Trick Shot all of the time.","mm_name":"tvtrope_example","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"JoJo's Bizarre Adventure","description":"A villanious example can be found in Hol Horse from JoJo's Bizarre Adventure; a Trick Shot, thanks to the fact that his Stand, the Emperor, is a revolver that lets him control the trajectory of its bullets.\n From part 5 we have Guido Mista whose stand Sex Pistols manifest as 6 imps who guide his bullets.\n Another example from the JoJoVerse is Ringo Roadagain, a semi-villainous example. He's a very solid Quick Draw. He has some Trick Shot in him, but that's a subtle subversion. He knows the most accurate distance for just about any revolver out there and he never fires one step outside of that range, which is why he never misses.","mm_name":"tvtrope_example","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Trinity Blood","description":"In the anime Trinity Blood, most of the heroes gunsling quite a bit, particuarly the Guns Akimbo, M13 Jericho wielding android Tres Iqus who has all three styles pretty much nailed (given that Gunslinger is actually his callsign this isn't at all suprising).","mm_name":"tvtrope_example","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Fullmetal Alchemist","description":"In several displays of skill, Riza Hawkeye from Fullmetal Alchemist combines ALL FOUR of the above types. Trick Shot is shown in her incredible long-distance sniping skill, while Vaporizer and The Woo are shown in her battles with the homunculi. Finally, Quick Draw is shown in Roy's fight with Scar.","mm_name":"tvtrope_example","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Mahou Sensei Negima!","description":"Mana Tatsumiya and Yuna Akashi of Mahou Sensei Negima!. Mana is a combination of Trick Shot and The Woo: she dual wields Desert Eagles, which is perhaps only marginally made believable by her size and is so skillful with a sniper rifle that she can also use ricocheting to work around the fact that her targets are behind a wall, but in close-range combat she falls into Gun Fu mode. Yuna is an obvious Quick Draw who uses twin pistols.","mm_name":"tvtrope_example","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha Striker S","description":"Teana Lanster of Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha Striker S is a Magical Girl gunslinger who uses The Woo style. Striker S Sound Stage X shows her adding some Vaporizer to her fighting style in the form of Starlight Breaker. Force's Arnage is a solid Vaporizer - Quad Gatlings, ho!","mm_name":"tvtrope_example","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Peacemaker Kurogane","description":"Ryoma from Peacemaker Kurogane.","mm_name":"tvtrope_example","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Gungrave","description":"Brandon Heat/Death Beyond the Grave from Gungrave: while during his human life Brandon preferred Trick Shot, The Woo, and Quick Draw, super-human strength of his undead state allowed him to carry big enough guns (the Cerberus handguns and the coffin) to add The Vaporizer to the list.","mm_name":"tvtrope_example","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Lupin III","description":"Daisuke Jigen from Lupin III is an expert shot who uses a custom .357 Magnum revolver to be the Trick Shot, The Woo, and the Quick Draw (0.3 seconds). Because of his strength in an array of guns, including rocket launchers and sniper rifles (which he shoots from the waist in The Castle of Cagliostro), he also qualifies as The Vaporizer. He actually dislikes More Dakka, saying that shooting more shots isn't better, especially when one will do the trick. He proves it in Lupin III Stolen Lupin, where he has a broken gun, and one bullet. This, against an enemy with automatic weapons in each hand.\n Lupin, Fujiko, and Zenigata are also good with their guns, but Lupin's the clear number two. His use of misdirection and disguise make him a better trick shot than Jigen, although many movies have Lupin's gun wrecked before he can fire.","mm_name":"tvtrope_example","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Bleach","description":"Bleach:\n Primera Espada Coyote Starrk's released form is that of a traditional wild-west outlaw equipped with a pair of guns. For the most part, he has exhibited Vaporizer and The Woo, albeit in a x100 fashion.\n  Suifeng's Bankai is a shoulder-mounted missile-launcher. Pure Vaporizer.\n Ururu beat Starrk as the first gunslinger by hundreds of chapters. She's a Vaporizer.\n The Stern Ritter \"N\" Robert Accutrone manifests his cross as a relatively ordinary looking pistol. This being Bleach, everything is but ordinary and the guy actually shoots out Shunsui's eye. Something even Starrk couldn't do.\n Stern Ritter \"X\" Lille Barro wields a powerful sniper rifle in combat. He's a mix of Vaporizer and Quick Draw,  able to blow a hole through the head of a Zero Squad member faster than she can react and whose special power, 'The X-Axis',  allows him to pierce anything in a straight line between the muzzle and the target, making defense absolutely useless.","mm_name":"tvtrope_example","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Soul Eater","description":"Soul Eater: Death the Kid is a combination. His usual style of a (literally) inhuman turn of speed, close-combat and Gun Fu falls under C, whereas Death Cannon and his other soul resonance attacks are B.\n The Thompson Sisters themselves also fit the trope. While they're technically the weapons of Death the Kid, they've both shown the ability to fight using each other quite proficiently.  Even more so now that Patty's become Liz's meister and Kid's possibly gone through a Face-Heel Turn.","mm_name":"tvtrope_example","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"General","description":"General Cross Marian of D.Gray-Man uses Innocence in the form of a revolver. He's a combination of Vaporizer and The Woo, and definitely qualifies as one of the most Bad Ass characters in the series.","mm_name":"tvtrope_example","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Yu-Gi-Oh! GX","description":"Yu-Gi-Oh! GX has Austin O'Brien, who pulls this off by firing trading cards from his duel disk, which doubles as gun. Said trading cards explode upon impact for some unexplained reason.\n He duels this way too. Everyone else in the show is The Beastmaster, commanding their monsters to attack. He just shoots you repeatedly with Blaze Accelerator (which uses cards as ammo).","mm_name":"tvtrope_example","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Zombie Powder","description":"C.T. Smith from the short-lived manga Zombie Powder; he had Trick Shot and The Woo in spades, with a splash of Quick Draw due to his super speed.","mm_name":"tvtrope_example","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Synthetic Human","description":"Synthetic Human Zoichi Kanoe, of Biomega, exhibits all types in virtually every fight he's involved in.","mm_name":"tvtrope_example","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Child Soldier","description":"Child Soldier Jonah from Jormungand is both The Trick Shot and The Quick Draw, which is quite unnerving to his mercenary teammates due to his young age. He also is not afraid to do a bit of Vaporizing when the situation requires it.","mm_name":"tvtrope_example","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Kino's Journey","description":"In Kino's Journey Kino is a formidable quick draw, often seen practicing it and later putting it to use with very effective results.","mm_name":"tvtrope_example","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Puella Magi Madoka Magica","description":"Puella Magi Madoka Magica has two Magical Girl Gunslingers, both Vaporizers. Mami Tomoe, prefers Gun Fu with a supply of single-shot muskets, but finishes with a BFG. And Homura Akemi, who combines her gunslinging composed of many military-grade weapons (including machine guns and RPGs) with lots of explosives and stopping time.\n In Rebellion Mami and Homura end up having a gun fight.  It was technically a draw.","mm_name":"tvtrope_example","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"City Hunter","description":"Ryo Saeba from City Hunter, a mercenary/bodyguard who has Improbable Aiming Skills with his handgun, making him a Trick Shot.","mm_name":"tvtrope_example","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann","description":"Yoko from Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann has elements of Trick Shot and Vaporizer. She carries an over-sized, high-energy sniper rifle with her wherever she goes..","mm_name":"tvtrope_example","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Kämpfer","description":"Akane from Kämpfer is normally a nice, quiet girl. Upon her transformation into a Kampfer however, her Bad Ass side appears along with a gun, and then starts firing at pretty much everything in sight she decides she doesn't like.","mm_name":"tvtrope_example","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Fairy Tail","description":"Bisca from Fairy Tail is the female half of a gunslinging Battle Couple with Alzack. Neither of them seems able to admit their feelings for one another.","mm_name":"tvtrope_example","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Gun Nut","description":"Maya from Burn Up W/Excess. Being a Gun Nut, she's so crazy for her weapons that she gives them names. Vaporizer, given that most of her arsenal qualifies as \"big guns\" and she has an itchy trigger finger.\n Her Burn Up Scramble incarnation leans more towards a Trick Shot, showcasing more shooting skill and less desire to just shoot.","mm_name":"tvtrope_example","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Shikabane Hime","description":"In Shikabane Hime, Makina's weapon of choice is a pair of MAC-11 machine pistols.","mm_name":"tvtrope_example","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Medabots","description":"Medabots: KBT-type Medabots, including Metabee, are designed for shooting techniques.

They not only fire regular bullets but also serve as the catalyst for her Time Master powers.","mm_name":"tvtrope_example","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Katekyo Hitman Reborn!","description":"Katekyo Hitman Reborn! has several, but overall less than you'd expect from a series about the Mafia.\n The eponymous hitman himself, Reborn, is the most notable example, and is an undisputed master of the Trick Shot. In one instance, he appears to misfire at the ground, only to have the bullets emerge from the earth several seconds later to strike his target with perfect accuracy.\n Xanxus, leader of the Varia, dual-wields Dying Will Guns that shoot out a beam of his highly destructive Flames of Wrath. Xanxus follows the path of the Vaporizer, as his named techniques largely involve him unloading a constant barrage on his opponent without any finesse whatsoever.\n Fabio, also known as Vongola VII, was the inventor of the original Dying Will Gun. It's unknown what type of style he used, but he only used a single gun compared to Xanxus's two, and he also possessed a much weaker Dying Will Flame to use for his bullets.","mm_name":"tvtrope_example","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"}],"location":"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGunslinger","mm_name":"tvtrope_folder","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Comic Books","examples":[{"title":"Batman","description":"Batman foe Deadshot is a villainous example of Trick Shot.

Hartigan is a Quick Draw since he usually draws and fires a single shot without having to move too much (he is pushing sixty with a bum-ticker, afterall). Dwight is The Woo. He usually has Guns Akimbo and does a lot of fancy footwork to avoid getting shot. Wallace is a Trick Shot, as evidenced by the fact that most of his shots are impossible to perform. At the end of his story, he shoots an entire warehouse filled with assassins before any of them manage to fire off a single round. Marv rarely uses a gun even though his is the most famous due to its name. From what we see, he's more of a quickdraw.","mm_name":"tvtrope_example","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Bazooka Jules","description":"Jules from Bazooka Jules is an extremely good shot with any type of gun, big or small, despite not having any combat experience.

In an act that might be considered kindness, Ataru hits Jariten with the frying pan, who goes flying...right into his mother's lap.

Capable of putting a bullet down the barrel of a sniper's BFG from a kilometer or so away. Earlier in the series, he attends a quick-draw contest, and is able to ensure that every hit is non-lethal by flicking pebbles at the bullets in-flight and altering their course. In the same contest, he tries to get out of the qualifying round by intentionally missing the targets; he fails. Missing, that is.\nVash: Eh... oops. I hit them all...\n Vash has the closest thing to an adequate justification for this kind of ability: He's been practicing, daily, with the same gun, for nigh-on 150 years.\n Nicholas D. Wolfwood from the same series was also quite good, especially for  a teenager, but he naturally pales against Vash.","mm_name":"tvtrope_example","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Grenadier","description":"Grenadier:\n Rushuna Tendo, the main character, is also a peace-loving, gun toting blonde in a red jacket. At one point, she stopped a massive barrage of bullets by firing a single bullet, that caused a chain reaction where each bullet deflected the next bullet down the line until the final bullet destroyed the machine gun firing said bullets.\n In the final battle in the series, in which Rushuna faces off against her Evil Counterpart, 80% of the bullets they fired would hit each other exactly between them. In one case, rapid-fired while jumping away from each other.\n The improbable aiming with these two starts well before a shot is even fired: to load their guns, they literally thrust their chests in the direction that allows the bullets stored in their cleavage to leap right into the loading chambers.\n The very first time you see Rushuna use her gun, she picks off a sniper from about a mile away. With a revolver. Firing it across her body at waist height.

The Marines present note that their guns aren't even capable of shooting that far, let alone successfully aim at that distance.\n Usopp tops himself in the Dressrosa arc, when he snipes someone in a castle through multiple windows from the other side of the island.\n Usopp also once shot a ball from his slingshot through a crown on a weathervane chicken that essentially across most of a city. He initially didn't see it because it was so far away.\n There are two other characters connected to Usopp, who, at least at the time of their introduction, actually outclassed Usopp in Improbable Aiming Skills. These are Yasopp, Usopp's father, who has claimed to be able to hit an ant between its eyes. The other is Van Auger, Usopp's obvious Evil Counterpart, who has demonstrated lethal accuracy from so far away the main characters can't even see the island he's shooting from. It is unclear whether or not Usopp has surpassed either yet, though it seems almost inevitable that he ultimately will. Van Auger shouldn't be surprising, as his clothes, gun, and aiming ability all seem to be taken directly from Terry Gilliam's The Adventures of Baron Munchausen.\n And now we have the Mato Mato fruit, who allows the user  (the fishman pirate Vander Decken IX) to turn whoever he touches into a target, so that any item he toss will chase him down forever and hit him, unless there is an unavoidable or faster-moving object in the way.\n Also Gill Bastard in One Piece Wanted\n Kizaru has shown himself to be a pretty accurate marksman too, shooting Luffy's seastone key in half from an incredibly long distance.\n Enel is able to use his Goro Goro Mi powers to strike people and objects from miles away using Mantra to sense where they are.","mm_name":"tvtrope_example","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Fullmetal Alchemist","description":"Fullmetal Alchemist:\n Riza Hawkeye's idea of disciplining a puppy is to empty a pistol's magazine around it, without even grazing the puppy.","mm_name":"tvtrope_example","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Ranma ½","description":"Ranma ½:\n Though normally she's Overshadowed by Awesome, sometimes to the point of being a Distressed Damsel (though, to be fair, her fiance Ranma Saotome gets the Distressed Damsel treatment too, sometimes actually being a damsel), Akane Tendo nevertheless is repeatedly shown to have amazing skill with thrown or projectile weapons.

Not enough for you? The pinnacle of improbable aim comes from the chapter \"Hollywood Cinderella\", where he aimed at a target by watching them on TV. He could probably shoot you from another continent given the right gun.\n In \"Room 909\", the second episode of the 2009 anime, the cops manage to get all the evidence they needed to incriminate him: they found him in the only hotel room the shot could be taken from, they found the custom precision rifle he used in the dust chute, they found the shell casing from the high-powered bullet(which a patrolman picked up when it was still warm, perfectly matching it to the time of death), etc. For all purposes, he was caught. Then... they did the math on the shot: 500 meters away(five football fields), through a two-foot gap between buildings(less than the length of an adult arm), at sundown with the sun shining on the window so the glare would render it all but opaque, with the wind blowing perpendicular to the line of fire requiring the shot to be off-center. Oh, and he put that Pretty Little Headshot right between the targets' eyes. Final assessment; the shot was STATISTICALLY IMPOSSIBLE. They had to let him go, because a trial would be a waste of time - despite the reams of evidence, no jury on Earth would believe a human being could make that shot, especially one that remained at the \"scene of the crime\" for a full day afterwards. And he chose the room in advance solely to take advantage of this - in order to convict him, people would first have to be convinced that Improbable Aiming Skills of his caliber are even possible. The head inspector even commented \"To prove that he's guilty, you'd have to prove there's a monster amongst us with the skills of a god.\" YEAH.\n Interestingly Golgo 13's signature weapon is an M-16 assault rifle instead of the usual purpose-built sniper rifle.

That and he also has skill with a real life sniper rifle.\n A less noticed example would be Lady Une of Gundam Wing. She managed a headshot with a standard hand gun, while the target was in free-fall and she was in the airplane she had thrown the target out of 8 seconds prior. Wing also has Trowa Barton, pilot of Gundam Heavyarms. In The Movie alone, we see him shooting missiles out of the air and fighting hundreds of opponents without a single fatality. Nothing impressive for your standard Cold Sniper, right? Well, Trowa does all this with Gatlings. On top of that, in one episode we see that Heavyarms' control system doesn't auto-compensate for the added weight of the Gatlings, meaning there's incredible resistance on the control sticksnote Heero attempts to move the arm when he's forced to use the Heavyarms in a duel, but it barely budges and he re-opens a wound inflicted earlier; on the plus side, this also means that the Heavyarms gains a massive boost in speed and maneuverability when the Gatlings run out of ammo and Trowa drops them.\n Mobile Suit Gundam SEED: Kira Yamato once he gets the Freedom Gundam.

It's such typical behavior that no one even mentions it.\n The main universe Hawkeye, in the Hawkeye And Mockingbird series, fired three Pym Particle arrows - arrows whose heads were capsules filled with dozens of toothpick-sized arrows that were treated with the chemical Ant-Man uses to get bigger/smaller. When they deployed and expanded, the thugs they were facing got to fight in the shade. Every single one was taken down non-fatally. Hawkeye simply said he never hits what he wasn't aiming for.

(Admittedly using Super Speed, but still.). In The Outsiders, while in a prison riot, Captain Boomerang Jr. had grabbed and thrown something, bouncing it off the walls, to hit and knock out a fellow prisoner.\n One of the only times Deadshot did miss, it was in his youth, a tree branch he was standing on snapped under him, and what should have been a disarming shot became a kill shot.

The drone's operators are rather shocked when they're told that the man they're trying to take out is only armed with a high-powered rifle.

When covering the aforementioned scene, the Critic demonstrates how this trope is in effect when he joins in with his gun, and continues killing henchmen no matter how random the shots he makes are, even when he's just flailing the gun around wildly.

Improbable Aiming Skills: The Movie. How bad? Throwing a curveball with bullets, shooting the wings off of insects, shooting down an enemy's bullet intentionally, and on and on. The fact that the ads showcase this and tell nothing about the plot... well, be afraid. Be very afraid.\n It's out now, and it's worse than you feared. Bullets fired from guns don't need to go in straight lines. With a flick of the wrist, an assassin can get a bullet to swerve around an obstacle and hit a target directly behind said obstacle. Yes, that means they can shoot around corners without relying on ricochets to change the trajectory. The most egregious example, hands-down, comes in the climax. A member of the Fraternity (a secret society of assassins that decides who to kill by studying textiles) has  decided that the abilities wielded by the assassins are too dangerous in the hands of mortals. This rebellious member fires a single bullet that travels around the room in a circular path, killing most of the remaining members, and comes back around, hitting the person who fired the bullet. Rule of Cool and all that.\n In the original comic series, Wesley is an impossibly good shot beyond any rational measure (it's a superpower). In the first comic he is forced to shoot the wings off of flies, in the end he does so by closing his eyes and shooting wildly around the room. Needless to say he succeeds. His father is also murdered by an unseen gunman who shoots him from \"two cities away\". Like the movie the plot of the comics is based entirely on Rule of Cool.\n It's just because Timur Bekmambetov does what he wants. (If you're curious, he directed the movies Night Watch and Day Watch, both of which were also largely founded on Rule of Cool.)\n This is taken to its logical extreme in the comic. Wesley and his father are literally perfect shots;  at the end of comic, Wesley's father forces him to execute him, because a few weeks ago he missed a target (with a pistol) at about half a mile, chalking it up to old age. He can't imagine being less than the absolute best.","mm_name":"tvtrope_example","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Support Your Local Sheriff","description":"In Support Your Local Sheriff James Garner is asked to demonstrate his gun handling skills and manages to both subvert and play the trope straight.

Most of the time he's not even concentrating on the rope, then he abruptly turns around and shoots. It turns out he learned his archery skills from William Tell.\n Sergeant Benton once hit a rooftop windvane across the village green and the Brig shot a man off a prison wall at about the same distance.\n An archer in \"The Time Warrior\" managed to shoot the axe out of a man's hand just as he was about to bring it down on the Third Doctor.\n The same archer later shoots the Sontaron in the probic vent from across the room.

It should be noted, however, that she did have training in being an assassin, so there is some reason for this.\n She follows up by shooting one of these enemies, without looking, when it pops up behind her. The reason this is particularly significant is these creatures are \"memory-proof\", meaning you don't remember anything about them if you're not looking at them.

She's a newspaper reporter, and a companion to the Doctor, so there's no evidence she's ever used a gun before, but she still manages a slightly difficult shot on the first try. She does mention that she had some experience with guns due to an uncle, though this was the only mention of the event.\n The 12th Doctor takes the Robin-Hood-Arrow-Split Up to Eleven in the season 8 episode Robot of Sherwood. Robin splits The Sheriff's arrow, then The Doctor splits his arrow, and the pair proceed to split several more of each others arrows in turn until The Doctor gets sick of it - \"Well, this is just getting silly\" - and blows up the target with his Sonic Screwdriver.

Jesse is able to shoot through Michael and kill the guy behind him, while only wounding Michael. Fiona makes a kill shot from afar while standing up.\n In a darker turn of events one of Team Westen's enemies displayed this when he killed  Anson and Michael's brother with the same bullet. When Michael interrogates this assassin he reveals that he was over a mile away looking at his target through the scope of a 50. caliber sniper rifle. At a distance like that a sniper would have to adjust his rifle to the left or the right to adjust for the direction of the wind so the bullet doesn't go off target, adjust for the rotation of the Earth, and raise his scope above the target by dozens of feet to account for bullet drop. The assassin actually mentions that he felt rather proud of himself for even managing to make a shot like that at all. Given who he killed though Michael is not at all amused.","mm_name":"tvtrope_example","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Green Arrow","description":"Green Arrow is an impressive shot on Smallville, able to shoot a specific country on a globe or into the opening of a soda can.

Later on when faced with a hostage taker he ricochets a bullet off a sign so it hits the bad guy in the back since it is the only shot he can take without hitting the hostage. He can also shoot the hinges off a door using two pistols Guns Akimbo from across a street. He can also use his power for throwing object and to execute incredible feats of acrobatics. (On top of having this as a superpower, Hicks is also a trained military sniper, so the odds of him missing any kind of shot with a gun are pretty low.)\n Also of note is Marcus from one of the first episodes. His power is a more extreme version of Hicks' (which has more psychological side effects than Hicks' does). In the first few minutes of the episode, he flicks a quarter and hits it on the precise spot on a bar that would cause it to fall and set such a chain of events moving that he would be able to escape the ambulance he was in.

Though wielding a revolver (and never, ever using his other hand to steady it), he's got unerring accuracy, on-par with even Sniper Wolf. He can even richochet bullets off of walls. When Cyborg Ninja cuts off his right hand, he just starts shooting with his left instead, without any perceptible drop in accuracy.\n Metal Gear Solid 3 subverts this; the future Big Boss, then known as Naked Snake, gave Ocelot the idea of using a revolver as his weapon of choice, after noticing that with his previous gun (a Makarov PM handgun), he twisted his elbow to absorb the recoil, which actually worsened his aim with it.\n Later in the same game, Ocelot adds a stock to the revolver to steady his aim for a long-range shot. And misses. Does he, though?\n In MGS3, the first time we see Ocelot, he displays Aiming Skills, managing to fire a bullet that ricochets multiple times before killing a Mook. When Snake later gets one of the revolvers, the bullets still ricochet, so he could concievably do the same if the player was good enough.\n Also subverted in The Twin Snakes, where, during the torture scene, Ocelot is spinning his gun on his left hand and drops it by accident — lending a bit of credibility that his left hand isn't quite as accurate as his right. He later goes on to shoot the PAL key out of Snake's hand near the end of the game.\n Ironically, in Twin Snakes, the legendary sniper villain character Sniper Wolf also subverts this trope by submitting to certain real-world sniping necessities of behavior: her accuracy suffers unless she's lying down, she takes an elevated position and plans ahead to hold that superior position throughout her battles. The irony comes from nearly every other villain in the game embodying a trope in order to make themselves unique, while Wolf's more conventional sniping ability is soundly trumped by Solid Snake's employment of two tropes multiplied together. In the cutscene in which Wolf is defeated (following a player-controlled sniper-fight boss battle in an outdoor snowfield in Alaska, against an enemy wearing all white, in the midst of a blizzard),  Snake is suddenly disarmed by Wolf shooting the PSG-1 sniper rifle from his grip and taking a bead on his forehead. She is undone, however, when Snake suddenly performs a perfect backflip, lands with his heel against the rifle's stock to propel it into the air, executes a full 360 turn to grab it, aims, and fires the killing shot straight into Wolf's lungs from more than a hundred yards distant. In Wolf's defense, she does recover from surprise in time to return fire simultaneously, but without the power of being the primary focus of the cutscene, her shot harmlessly misses. The combined power of Improbable Aiming Skills and Cutscene Power to the Max has a resonance, it seems, rendering the protagonist briefly perfect.\n Spoofed and taken to a ridiculous extreme in this strip among others from The Last Days of FOXHOUND.","mm_name":"tvtrope_example","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Assassin's Creed I","description":"Altaïr, the main character of Assassin's Creed I, also displays an unbelieveable level of accuracy with his throwing-knives.

This makes incredibly impressive his ability to rapidly learn to use an assault rifle well enough to fight off both an alien invasion and a battalion of highly trained special forces soldiers.\n Lampshaded in the sequel, in which Breen, through his \"Breencast\" system, berates his mook army for being completely unable to impede Gordon's progress: \"This is not some agent provocateur or highly trained assassin we are discussing. Gordon Freeman is a theoretical physicist who hardly earned the distinction of his Ph.D at the time of the Black Mesa Incident... The man you have consistently failed to slow, let alone capture, is by all standards simply that, an ordinary man.\"\n The Female Assassins in Half-Life count as well. It's unknown who they're working, they're never mentioned by any characters in Half-Life, and the only game that puts focus on them is of debatable canon. Of all we don't know, one thing is for certain, an Assassin with a 9mm pistol will never miss a shot. Dispite their weak weaponry, Assassins are a higher threat than the Special Forces you spend half the game fighting, largely in part because of their pin-point accuracy and quick trigger fingers.","mm_name":"tvtrope_example","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Fallout 3","description":"The Lone Wanderer in Fallout 3 takes this trope to ridiculous extremes, being able to shoot a switchblade out of someone's hand and follow it up with a perfect headhsot. From fifty metres away. With a sightless (I shit you not) hunting rifle. He can still miss with a shotgun at point-blank range, oddly enough.\n And that headshot doesn't even appear to be a true headshot. Instead the target is decapitated with a Clean Cut, the seemingly undamaged head lying next to the corpse. This is particularly hilarious when considering that the ammo used by Sniper rifles and the 'Infinity plus one rifle', Lincoln's Repeater (.308 and .44 Magnum, respectively) would have caused a lot of Pink Mist to spurt from the headless body. Compare a point blank hit with a shotgun which blows the enemy into many bloody chunks.\n The head does explode if it is crippled.\n The sniper rifles and repeater are nice, but they just don't provide the satisfaction that decapitating someone with a BB gun does.\n The mechanics behind weapon spread can be somewhat interesting, being a sum of the weapon's minimum spread, spread caused by injury (0 if uninjured), and spread based on skill, stance, and ironsight use. Because level 100 skill with a weapon changes the last value from .005 to 0 and the effects from ironsights and crouching are multiplicative on the skill value, that single skill point makes both of them completely irrelevant.","mm_name":"tvtrope_example","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Fallout: New Vegas","description":"Fallout: New Vegas retains the ridiculous extremes mentioned above for the player.

This leads to cases where you can have an archer shoot at something that's pretty much 2 tiles away and 10 storeys above, or have a gunner SHOOT THROUGH A MOUNTAIN FACE AT POINT BLANK RANGE and hit the target on the other side, 7 panels away.\n It's amusing to think that a bullet backed up by Ultima Charge would behave this way.","mm_name":"tvtrope_example","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Call of Duty","description":"Compared to other AI allies throughout the series, Captain MacMillan from Call of Duty 4 is a deadshot.

Of special note is that the computer tends to be completely suck with normal shotguns at long ranges, but does quite a few headshots with the BLUNDERBUSS. Speculation has it that this is due to a couple of the set patterns of blunderbuss firing arcs, and the height at which the computer naturally aims. If you require evidence, use all zombie characters, while playing one yourself, and take note of the amount of headless people running around in some all blundie games.\n Also see: any oldschool 2d sprite FPS, where so long as you can see the creature in the distance, if he has a bullet-type attack which deals instantaneous damage, he can hit you very easily, even if he's a few pixels high.

Yes, for some reason a thrown baseball is more likely to kill you than an assault rifle in these sorts of games. For your part, however, you're quick enough on the draw to shoot whatever's coming at you out of the air with a single shot. Here are a few highlights of the genre:\n Area 51: You can shoot grenades, oil drums, and RPGs out of the air with one shot from a pistol.\n Target Terror: You can shoot groups of dynamite (complete with timer) out of the air with a single pistol shot. Apparently they must have set said timers for 4 seconds, as they will explode the instant they hit you. Not only that, but one of the bonus levels involves you doing this while terrorists throw a non-stop string of dynamite bombs attached to frozen turkeys at you!\n To neutralize the hijacker, you must shoot out his rather small Dead Man Switch remote, otherwise he blows up the plane.\n House of the Dead: Zombies will throw axes at you. This in itself is amazing, but they will always hit unless you shoot them out of the air with a single shot. Always. Even when the zombie throwing it is fifty feet away, TEN FEET BELOW YOU, AND DECAPITATED! \n Silent Scope: Sniping from a moving vehicle? Check. Shooting out the rotor of a helicopter from said vehicle? Check. Sniping a boss with a meat shield in another erratically-moving vehicle? Check. Sniping searchlights while parachuting? Check.

You have to wait 'til he faces the other direction entirely to sneak up on him.\n In Batman: Arkham Origins this is Taken Up to Eleven by Deadshot again. In the trailer, he shatters the sword in Deathstroke's hand several time in rabid succession from several miles away, right before shooting a single chain-link holding up a large crate. In his introduction, he is seen killing three enemies in one shot while said enemies were spaced out! In the actual gameplay, he is able to shoot a SWAT sniper, then ricochet the bullet off of his head and into the tail of a GCPD helicopter, causing it to spiral out of control and crash.

It wouldn't be nearly as absurd if not for the fact that they're throwing axes at you.\n Also used in Mordecai's back story.

While still in air, tap the fire button rapidly. Voila, dead soldiers lying flat, all taken one bullet each in the span of about what, 2 to 3 seconds?\n Subverted somewhat in that automatic firing will cause a decrease in accuracy the longer the trigger is held no matter the player's stance.\n Even more spectacular, is the throwing of objects(even while moving in the air).

If that's not badass enough, the AI always relies on wind, so even if a straightforward shot at maximum power will still hit, they'll settle for firing in the opposite direction with somewhere between 10 and 50% of power and the shot will still do max damage. That's to say that the AI frequently does shots that could be classified as improbable at best, then there are the shots that go through a gap that by all accounts should not fit a bazooka and that's while the said bazooka is doing a turn under the influence of a very strong wind. Not badass enough? The AI using a bazooka is the preferred option for you; if the enemy pulls out a grenade, you can only pray it doesn't target the worm that will actually die by taking maximum grenade damage. Their favourite tactic is to make the grenade ricochet a bit (say, at least 3-5 times) and land on the head of your worm at the same time the fuse time runs out.\n And this is on all difficulty levels; the only real difference is that lower AI levels will either sometimes miss (on purpose) or just be really bad at picking targets.\n The \"Cocky\" AI in Worms Reloaded does this on purpose.

This is especially impressive as he did it twice, using a gun not designed for that range (though still a sniper rifle). He is followed by Rob Furlong, at 2,430 meters. The difficulty of these long ranges is pointed out by the facts like Furlong's shot, at a moving target, took 4 seconds to go from the gun and had a bullet drop of about 146 feet. Beating even that was Royal Marine Matt Hughes. Although his shot at an Iraqi sentry was a relatively short 860 meters, the gale-force crosswind meant his bullet curved 56 feet sideways.\n Simo Häyhä. Of particular note is that Häyhä did all of his work without a scope. Yeah. The greatest sniper in history killed 546 Soviet soldiers using only iron sights. He may not have matched other snipers in sheer range, but you have got to respect a sniper so skilled he hunted with only a pair of very fine-tuned bits of metal telling him where his shots were going to go. The Russians were flat fucking terrified of him by the end of the Winter War; they called him the White Death for a reason.\n He was eventually presented with a higher-quality rifle, but removed the scope because 1. the shine off the lens could give away his position to enemy snipers and 2. he didn't need it, as noted above.\n Rifleman Thomas Plunket. In 1809, using a black powder rifle over an open sight, he shot a French general dead at a range of 500 meters. Then he shot the first man to come to the general's aid, just to prove it wasn't a lucky shot.\n Billy Dixon. He and a group of Bison hunters were defending the settlement of Adobe Walls from Comanches. Dixon, armed with a Sharps rifle, knocked a Comanche off his horse at a surveyed range of 1,538 yards.\n Even as Billy Dixon was (most possibly) one of the best long-range riflemen in the entire world, he did not give much credit to his shot and did not attempt to duplicate it.\n Military snipers in general. US Army snipers average one confirmed kill for every 1.78 bullets fired. Add in the probable kills, and the accuracy goes up to one kill for every 1.32 bullets fired.\n Craig Harrison not only hit a target over 8,000 feet away with a rifle designed to have an effective distance of 5,000 feet, but decided that wasn't badass enough and did it twice.\n Not reported in that link is that with his third shot, Corporal Harrison disabled the machine gun his targets were using. As they say in America, three up, three down.\n An unknown Australian commando (there were two people shooting simultaneously at a single target and it isn't very clear who out of the two made the shot) hit an enemy commander from a GPS-confirmed distance of 2815 meters/3079 yards, which is more than 9000 feet away.\n It should be noted that modern military snipers use computers to calculate bullet drop and wind effects and secondary spotters to feed them distance and wind information before taking their shots; making the shooter mostly a steady hand on the trigger. Vietnam era and earlier snipers often forewent spotters—as noted, 1 man, 1 gun, and real skill, though one must also remember that in modern settings both the sniper and the spotters are often trained to do it the old-fashioned way with physical or memorized bullet drop tables, just in case the electronic gear gets disabled.","mm_name":"tvtrope_example","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"The Other Wiki","description":"In 2005 in Ar Ramadi, Iraq, a patrol was on a rooftop in the eastern part of the city scouting out sniper positions.

The fire was so devastating the German commanders thought the Americans had machine guns.\n A similar feat has been attributed to a British rifle platoon at a bridge in 1914. The British trained specifically for this pre-war with the \"Mad Minute\" training exercise in which riflemen had to put at least 15 aimed shots into a 12\" target 300 yards away within 60 seconds — with a bolt-action rifle. And many riflemen could average over 30. To illustrate how impressive this is, the United States Marine Corps trains for between ten and twelve aimed shots per minute with semi-automatic fire and thirty-round magazines.

On 1 September 1942, he took off in his Bf109, shooting down three Kittyhawk fighters out of ten attacking a Ju-87 formation, and on his way back to base he was attacked by a group of Spitfires, shooting down six. When reloading the plane, his armorer discovered that Marseille had expended only 20 cannon rounds and 60 machine-gun rounds to shoot down all nine aircraft.\n This is a slightly unfair way to measure aiming skill, however, as the Bf109 armament included a pair of 20 mm cannons, while the early war Spitfires it was facing of with were equipped with 8 .30 caliber machine guns (which are practically pea shooters in air-to-air terms). One 20 mm shell did a lot more damage than ten .30 caliber bullets.\n It is not unfair when you compare it to the ammunition used by other pilots flying the same type of aircraft. Also, the Bf 109-F and Bf 109- G airplanes which Marseille flew in North Africa only had one cannon, which fired through the hollow axis of the propeller. As the two machine guns were mounted on top of the engine, the projectiles from the three guns hit very close to each other. The guns of a Spitfire were mounted in the wings, which made more for a kind of scatter-gun effect.\n But while talking about Spitfires, Canadian pilot Buzz Beurling became legendary flying out of Malta for his obscene skills in deflection and long-range shooting. Initially considered a braggart when he was flying out of England because his gun camera didn't record the hits he claimed he was making, it was later realized that he was so good at calculating trajectories of bullets and enemy planes that he'd fire before the aircraft came in view of the camera. Once he reached Malta, he had his mechanics remove tracer rounds from his ammunition because he didn't need them to know where his rounds were going (and so the enemy didn't know they were being shot at), and made the longest recorded kill with a Spitfire, taking down another plane at 800 yards.","mm_name":"tvtrope_example","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"applied the mathematical skills of his former vocation to make extremely accurate deflection shots","description":"René Fonck, the most successful Allied air ace of World War I, had a confirmed count of 75 victories.

I rather liked all the \"Twilight\" movies until now and this one is, to my personnal taste, as good as the previous ones - and even in one aspect a little bit better, as Edward and Bella finally become lovers. Below, you will find a short description of what I believe are the best elements of this film, with limited SPOILERS:1. Actors. All actors evolved as the serie continued and I believe they all got better with time. Robert Pattinson and Taylor Lautner are both excellent, but - in my humble opinion - it is Kristen Stewart who in this movie shines the most. Quite a lot of people frequently criticized her actorship claiming that she simply can not play at all and has a very limited assortment of expressions in her tool box. But for me, after reading \"Twilight\" books, this is how the character of Bella should be. I can hardly picture her wide smiling with all her teeth bared or doing any other highly extraverted things like that. In fact I believe that either by design or by accident Kristen Stewart got the things right about this character - her minimalistic approach to facial expressions actually makes (for me) Bella very believable and also quite likeable. In this part of the story, Bella takes a more dynamic approach to life by taking her destiny firmly under control. She makes important decisions and takes extreme risks, stubbornly resisting the opposite advice of all her family and friends - all of that in a deceptively unassuming way... And Kristen Stewart acted in the movie exactly as I pictured Bella did it, when I read the books. A very good job!Read more ›","rating":"5 stars","location":"http://www.amazon.com/Twilight-Saga-Breaking-Two-Disc-Special/dp/B002BWP49C","mm_name":"review","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Above and Beyond Expectations","description":"Being a huge fan of the books and a pretty big fan of the movies, I was blown away at what a great job they did with this movie installment. I loved the visual and audio parallels they drew between the original movie, Twilight, and this movie. For instance (Spoiler Alerts throughout): I loved how they played Flightless Bird during the wedding ceremony and the way the camera circled them kissing in the same manner the camera circled E & B kissing at Prom at the very end of Twilight. It was a subtle, yet stunning way to visually tie the two movies together and really made more of an emotional impact than if they had just shot them straight on and plugged in a different song. That was genius. And that dress...gorgeous. Just as it was described in the book.I also loved that rather than having one continuous honeymoon \"consummation\" scene, they broke it up with Bella thinking about certain moments the next morning after looking in the mirror for the first time, where she's no longer a virgin. It was all done so tastefully. The way one's first time should be at that age. Not at some house party or in the back of some guy's car. For those who read the books and knew how Edward did everything he could to exhaust Bella with activities on their honeymoon so she'd be too tired to \"try again\", you have to admit that Bill Condon did such a great job showing you visually all the things they were doing without either character having to come out and say, I'm/you're trying to exhaust you/me. And it was adorable with KS put on her little nightgown and leaned against the wall...I got married when I was 19 and I felt the exact same way when I put on lingerie for the first time and dreaded walking into the bedroom with my little gown on.Read more ›","rating":"5 stars","location":"http://www.amazon.com/Twilight-Saga-Breaking-Two-Disc-Special/dp/B002BWP49C","mm_name":"review","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Extended Material Makes the Movie More Complete","description":"Without giving away the added scenes they are a MUST for any Twilight lover!!!!... They are not really extended scenes but new scenes added in.  There is not longer version of the wolves running or such but whole new scenes that blend well with the movie. I think they should have been in the original cut.  Allot of films add in extra scenes that quite don't add to the film or slow it down but these added scenes for Part 1 really give the movie added punch!  I just loved watching the bonus scenes. It was also fun not knowing where they will show up so it almost like watching a new movie!...  Get this you won't regret it.I did get my copy on ebay where they had The Twilight Saga Complete Collection Box Set. It has all 5 movies on blu ray plus digital copies of all of them. Also it includes the audio commentary as an option!  And.... It has the Extended Edition of Breaking Dawn Part 1.....The Digital copies on the 5 Movie Box Set are on Cinema Now which is a great free app for storing movies where you can watch them on any device without taking up GB space on your device. They also download. At first I didn't think I would like Cinema Now compared to iTunes but then I saw my Blu Ray player had the option and I can watch my movies at a press of a button from Cinema Now. Its also available on SmartTvs. So it cool to have all the digital copies! I thought this was the best deal out there.","rating":"5 stars","location":"http://www.amazon.com/Twilight-Saga-Breaking-Two-Disc-Special/dp/B002BWP49C","mm_name":"review","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Bellas Wedding Edition is just beautiful","description":"From the raised, reproduced lace on the DVD package that matches Bellas Wedding gown, to the simply gorgeous, delicate silk commemorative flag/poster of their wedding photo, this is a no-brainer, must have edition to build your collection, ladies! Included is the music from the film, the movie disk, a documentary disk that shows how they used a dummy to make Bella appear so emaciated as her pregnancy withRenesmee progressed, and so much more. I was gifted this from my brother who works at WalMart and hid it away for me a week before the release/sale date, and I had no idea it was a wedding version.Upon receiving it you feel like you are truly apart of the Wedding, and that this rare DVD set is your wedding favor!The movie is beautiful, the packaging is beautiful - It truly is one of those instances where you need to buy the rare edition, in this case, this very Wedding Dress Edition.

First off I notice major black light bleed out of the box & even after tweaking the TV on my own until I found the right settings from a other users.What I really like about this tv is that my playstation 3 is synced with the tv. My tv come's on when the playstation is turned on and I can control my ps3 with my Samsung remote nice feature.  The tv is nice a thin not very heavy. The 2d to 3d conversion is total crap some stuff looks good but for the most part it's a BIG gimmick. Movies & stuff filmed in 3D look amazing sometimes it's a hit & miss. So far my favorite 3d movies are : ( Monsters Vs Aliens ) ( avatar ) ( Despicable me )  Resident evil looked like crap & I really didn't like monster house. I am hoping the studios will improve 3D filming and make live action films pop out more. I tried some playstation 3 games in 3d I like the idea but WoW it really makes your eyes hurt after awhile.Setting up the tv was pretty easy I did found setting up the wireless on the Tv to be a real pain. I am pretty good with computers and wireless network it was still a pain. I have a netgear router and I was not able to link it with normal settings the tv kept saying my pass word was wrong password ended up doing the button method on my router and samsung tv. Right away the Tv found the router and no more issues.Now for the calibration settings that will make your set look amazing and reduce the famous Samsung clouding issue and black light bleeding which I couldn't stand until this ! Make sure you have a hdmi 1.4 cable I did notice a issue with my old hdmi cable and the 1.4 cable solved the slow lag, any cheap one will do as long as it's 1.Read more ›","rating":"5 stars","location":"http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-UN60D7000-60-Inch-1080p-Silver/dp/B004QFGGTY","mm_name":"review","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Backlight bleeding - Not an expert review but will help you a lot","description":"I'm going to cut down to the chase.The TV has so many good features (especially design) that are too many to list, thus, I will focus on the two things I have encountered that I know someone else might have experienced or will experience and are rather disappointing...but don't lose your hopes just yet!1) Backlight bleeding - My TV came set up for 'store' usage mode, instead for 'home', which increases the bleeding drastically.Changing to 'home' is quite challenging so you have to read the manual. After I changed the usage mode to 'home', it decreased considerably but was still noticeable.I visited some forums, websites, and some even advised to put pressure on the screen with my fingers (until I see the screen changing colors), etc, but nothing seemed to work.I decided to contact Samsung support and they advised me to change PICTURE MODE to 'STANDARD' and adjust the 'BACKLIGHT' to the value of '7'. The support guy/girl mentioned to leave this setting on for 3 weeks. After the three weeks, I should be able to change to any picture mode and to any value for the backlight. Finally, it was mentioned that if I did not see any changes, that a service ticket needs to be placed at this link (you will need to register your TV with Samsung): [...]I made the change today 4/15/2011 so I will wright another review within 3 weeks to let you know the end results.2) Sound stops working - I only have a PS3 and a DirecTV satellite box connected to the TV via HDMI cables (hight speed and 3D capable). I have noticed the TV produces no sound for like 1 second and then gradually comes back at a lower volume until it reaches the original volume.Read more ›","rating":"4 stars","location":"http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-UN60D7000-60-Inch-1080p-Silver/dp/B004QFGGTY","mm_name":"review","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Great TV... If there is no flaw.","description":"I just got the TV in today, and from I experience so far is that this TV is amazing.Black level is great! One of the best I seen so far.Internet connection is great on the TV. Very useful for watching Netflix.The qwerty remotes that came with my TV is very useful for web browsing, but don't expect the browser to be like normal computer browser because it is very bad, slow, hard to navigate, and cumbersome.For gaming, in my opinion, there is no lag if you turn off the picture enhancements options, and also turning on the game mode. I would say the lag on the TV would be probably somewhere between 30-50ms.3D is great! I watched Shrek 3D, and it's just stunning. A major improvement from last year model. I probably will buy Tron 3D, and see it on the TV soon.Cons: HDMI input is located on the side. Clouding & Flashlighting that can be seen in dark screen.Update: After 2 weeks of having the TV I noticed some flash lighting / clouding that can be seen in pitch black room. Not a big deal at first, but overtime I am starting to be annoyed by it. I am thinking of getting it exchange for higher end model. Therefore I am rating the TV 3/5 stars. If would be a solid 5 stars if there is no flaw.Update 2:  Returned my set and bought 46\" Sony HX929.","rating":"3 stars","location":"http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-UN60D7000-60-Inch-1080p-Silver/dp/B004QFGGTY","mm_name":"review","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"The new Gold Standard of TV's","description":"The short version: FantasticI don't care about 3D. If it weren't for thrusting swords pointed at the audience, there would be no 3D content. But, in order to get the best picture today's technology has to offer, you have to buy the 3D feature. I hate the manufacturers for doing this to the public, but they have a lot of money riding on the success of 3D. Well, 3D ain't going to happen for them in any great numbers.I compared many big display TV's, but I kept returning to the D7000. It looked stylish and the picture was just outstanding. I had a salesman plug in a blu-ray player to several TV's and I fine tuned them all, but when all was said and done, the Samsung had that something extra than I could not quantify.  Two days later it was in my living room.The TV is slow to turn on. It is not instant-on. I hate that. There is only so much time you get in this life and using that precious time waiting for a TV to come is a waste. Samsung engineers need to do better. Anyway, give it at least five seconds for the picture to appear. When going online with the TV, another five or ten seconds are required. Tick. Tick.

Search the web for a PDF manual for 55\" D7000 to get an idea of this set's flexibility as the two have similar operational characteristics.Read more ›","rating":"5 stars","location":"http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-UN60D7000-60-Inch-1080p-Silver/dp/B004QFGGTY","mm_name":"review","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"}],"companion_products":[{"main_images":[{"location":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/417M44vq19L._SL500_SR100,100_.jpg","mm_name":"image","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"}],"title":"Samsung UN60F7100 60-Inch 1080p 240Hz 3D Ultra Slim Smart LED HDTV (2013 Model)","price":"$2,173.64","location":"http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-UN60F7100-60-Inch-1080p-240Hz/dp/B00BCGRQ7Q/ref=pd_sim_sbs_e_1?ie=UTF8&refRID=0GPA0R7YS6V058WHPK29","mm_name":"amazon_product","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"main_images":[{"location":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51K524fE2bL._SL500_SR100,100_.jpg","mm_name":"image","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"}],"title":"Samsung UN65D8000 65-Inch 1080p 240 Hz 3D LED HDTV (Silver) (2011 Model)","price":"$2,173.64","location":"http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-UN65D8000-65-Inch-1080p-Silver/dp/B004Y45RXI/ref=pd_sim_sbs_e_2?ie=UTF8&refRID=0GPA0R7YS6V058WHPK29","mm_name":"amazon_product","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"main_images":[{"location":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51VlB3Ee1eL._SL500_SR100,100_.jpg","mm_name":"image","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"}],"title":"Samsung UN60ES8000 60-Inch 1080p 240Hz 3D Slim LED HDTV (Silver) (2012 Model)","price":"$2,173.64","location":"http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-UN60ES8000-60-Inch-1080p-Silver/dp/B0074FGTJA/ref=pd_sim_sbs_e_3?ie=UTF8&refRID=0GPA0R7YS6V058WHPK29","mm_name":"amazon_product","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"main_images":[{"location":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51yF23%2BiD5L._SL500_SR100,100_.jpg","mm_name":"image","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"}],"title":"Samsung UN60F8000 60-Inch 1080p 240Hz 3D Ultra Slim Smart LED HDTV (2013 Model)","price":"$2,173.64","location":"http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-UN60F8000-60-Inch-1080p-240Hz/dp/B00BCGRLX0/ref=pd_sim_sbs_e_4?ie=UTF8&refRID=0GPA0R7YS6V058WHPK29","mm_name":"amazon_product","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"main_images":[{"location":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51cQivIcPJL._SL500_SR100,100_.jpg","mm_name":"image","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"}],"title":"Samsung UN60D6000 60-Inch 1080p 120Hz LED HDTV (Black) [2011 MODEL] (2011 Model)","price":"$2,173.64","location":"http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-UN60D6000-60-Inch-1080p-120Hz/dp/B004NB8DX8/ref=pd_sim_sbs_e_5?ie=UTF8&refRID=0GPA0R7YS6V058WHPK29","mm_name":"amazon_product","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"main_images":[{"location":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/417M44vq19L._SL500_SR100,100_.jpg","mm_name":"image","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"}],"title":"Samsung UN60F7500 60-Inch 1080p 240Hz 3D Ultra Slim Smart LED HDTV","price":"$2,173.64","location":"http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-UN60F7500-60-Inch-1080p-240Hz/dp/B00BCGROGE/ref=pd_sim_sbs_e_6?ie=UTF8&refRID=0GPA0R7YS6V058WHPK29","mm_name":"amazon_product","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"}],"specifications":[{"value":"Sleep Timer","mm_name":"specification","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"value":"3D Compatiblity","mm_name":"specification","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"name":"Product Dimensions:","value":" \n    \n    13.8 x 54.3 x 34.9 inches ; 50.5 pounds","mm_name":"specification","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"name":"Shipping Weight:","value":" 71.3 pounds (View shipping rates and policies)","mm_name":"specification","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"name":"Shipping:","value":" This item can only be shipped to the 48 contiguous states.

It never forgets that, when viewed as a whole, these eight movies are a story of growing up, of the transition from childhood to adulthood. Of love and friendship and death. Because without those little funny and touching moments between the characters - if all you want is for the movies to rush from one plot element to another - then all you're left with is plot... and no story. Remember: plot is what happens TO the characters; story is what happens AS A RESULT of the characters.That's the real gorgeous beauty of these movies, and it's what will bring viewers back repeatedly to their DVD shelves. As Frodo said to Sam in `The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers': \"What are we fighting for Sam?\" \"That's there's still some good in this world,\" Sam replies, \"and that it's worth fighting for.\"That's why you need those little indulgent moments, because without them it's just razzle-dazzle special effects and set-pieces.

You do not get to keep the 'digital copy' as it expires after three years from when you register it.  It is currently impossible to download a physical digital copy without also putting Warner's Flixter application on your computer so they can DOCUMENT AND CONTROL your entire movie collection (if you read the terms, they also state that you may lose access to ANY of your movie content at anytime... even if it was not obtained through UV by installing this software).Read all the terms and conditions.  Read the privacy policy (or lack thereof) on Flixter and UV.It is all a scam.I wish studios would stop being stupid and just go with what works.  Get over the greed and try to look at things from your customers perspective for a change.  Studios will find they make A LOT more money when they stop fighting their customers and simply make good movies.All this does is push legitimate purchasers to piracy as an only

Initially it meant to serve me as a second laptop for occasional light work online, but very soon I realized that I was using it most of the time. My powerful Windows laptop and Mac mini were just sitting there collecting dust, getting my attention only once a week at best. I replaced my Samsung with Acer C720 2 GB RAM version two weeks ago.Here's a quick breakdown.- C720 has a slightly better screen than Samsung. Same washed out colors, but contrast and viewing angles are better, and so is brightness level. If you are spoiled by the screens of modern tablets, you might think that 1366x768 resolution would look unattractive. That's not quite right. I should remind you that MacBook's Air 11 screen has the same resolution and the same size. It's just enough to do what it's designed to do.- The keyboard layout of C720 may not be as good as Samsung's, but I like Acer's feel and key movement better. Unless you have very large hands, it might provide one of the best typing experiences in the price range below $300, and it's definitely better than most Windows laptops for that price. I write quite a lot and C720's keyboard didn't cause any significant discomfort so far. Touchpad is reasonably good, but nothing to be overexcited about. I only wish it was a bit larger.- C720 is WAY faster than Samsung. Don't be deceived by the name of the processor - this Celeron unit from the Haswell family has more processing power than Chrome OS requires. And 2 GB of RAM should be absolutely enough for anyone, who normally doesn't keep over a dozen tabs running heavy websites simultaneously. The fan would kick in from time to time, but it's very quiet and is never annoying.Read more ›","rating":"5 stars","location":"http://www.amazon.com/Acer-C720-Chromebook-11-6-Inch-2GB/dp/B00FNPD1VW/","mm_name":"review","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Inexpensive, lightweight and powerful. The C720 2GB version is one of the best buys in tech. Period.","description":"I'm a technology addict and I've been following the development of ChromeOS for a while. When it first came out, I totally understood the concept but wanted to wait for it to mature a while and the prices to come down. My trigger price point was $200 so when the 2GB version of C720 came out, I had to have one.I find it amazing that such an inexpensive device can do so much. After having it a week, it became my favorite machine just because it is so simple and light. After using it, you come to question why we need such big computing power, huge hard discs and RAM just to run a traditional OS when it comes to supporting the use cases for about 90% of what you use a PC to do. Whats even better, the Chromebook is pretty much ready to go out of the box, with an already pretty rich supply of online an offline apps don't cost you anything extra.Just like tablets came on the market and turned the PC industry upside down because they did 80% of a PC did, and did it with a better user experience, lower price with much less hardware spec. In the same way, I think the Chromebook will have a permanent place in personal tech as the one matching basic needs at the cheapest price - a second PC for around the home, or the \"throwaway\" unit for travel where you don't have to worry about damaging or losing it because its both cheap and highly secure.Specific to the C720 - I agree with most that the screen could be much better but it is still quite acceptable considering the price. The trackpad and the keyboard as well - I have no trouble using them and the trackpad is actually better than many more expensive PCs. I think the build quality is actually quite good - it looks professional and robust enough so that it can survive a road warrior's abuse.Read more ›","rating":"5

This is truly a fantastic album in every sense of the word.  And the techniques used in the creation were just fabulous.  One of the things my friend said when he first heard me playing it was \"the samples sound so CLEAN!\"  And they do.  Every sample has been processed at incredibly high quality, there is no \"Lo-Fi\" on this record.  The entire record is permeated with funky-style samples that you swear you know but just can't seem to place.  Every song has some fantastic SOMETHING about it:1.One More Time - the perfect party track! a thick thumping bassline and everybody-that's-not-a-raver's-view of the raver world lyrics -:)-, catches your attention immediately.2.Aerodynamic - by far, the most significant bit on this track is the squealing pseudo-guitar solo.  It may be simple, but it sounds REALLY COOL!3.Digital Love - early 80's motivational tapes samples with cheesy vocoded lyrics = something still meaningful?  To be honest, it's still fun to listen to, despite it's cheesiness.4.Harder, Better Faster, Stronger - one of my favorite songs on the record. Easy to dance to, but it features one of the most incredible things I've ever heard.  To understand you have to know what a vocoder is.  A vocoder is a device that takes your voice, specifically the vibrations in your voice, and converts it to the tone of the instrument it is attached to, which is almost ALWAYS a keyboard for simplicity.  What's really neat about Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger, is that at 2:25, the vocoder is switched over to an odd device that triggers it by a guitar.  It's especially obvious at certain points, where the player is playing a really neat solo.Read more ›","rating":"5 stars","location":"http://www.amazon.com/Discovery-Daft-Punk/dp/B000059MEK","mm_name":"review","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Brilliant. Awesome. I'd like to play it \"One More Time\"","description":"Now this is interesting. Apparently these guys have been famous for quite a while, yet somehow I'd never heard of them. All that was remedied recently though. When I heard that Leiji Matsumoto had created a full-length animated feature with stunning animation based on an ablum by Daft Punk, I just had to check it out. While my opinion of that excellent piece of animation is mixed (I just didn't dig the story or think most of it matched the songs all that well), it did something to me. It made me buy the album it was based on \"Discovery\". Wow.In this case, it seemed more like the music video was just a distraction than an extension of the music. When I first started listening to the album I thought it was okay, but as I progressed through it, listening to the songs in order, and then repeating some just to hear them one more time, I got HOOKED.It's hard to describe. I love electronic music and techno and all that sort of thing, but this is different. The voices and music are all really just toyed with by the musical artists in these songs. Everything is just a way to get you into a feeling, of a rhythm, or a beat. The more you hear the songs, they more they grow on you, the more you get into them, the more you like them, the more you listen to them.Take that song \"One more time\". That song is downright addictive! The beat is so infectious that I found I absolutely had to move to the song while I was listening to it. Ditto for the next three tracks. \"Aerodynamic\" is amazing because it uses electric guitar like a piano player uses his keyboard, not just for show, but to extend and play with a melody, finally turning it into a music-box version of itself before transforming into my favorite song on the album \"Digital Love\". I love that song.Read more ›","rating":"5 stars","location":"http://www.amazon.com/Discovery-Daft-Punk/dp/B000059MEK","mm_name":"review","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Brilliant CD! Best of the year so far.","description":"Let me start by saying this CD is really great!Its definitely Daft Punk's most 80's sounding release, but has a lot more to it than something like \"Darkdancer\" by Les Rhythm Digitales. Where that CD was very one sided, \"Discovery\" is a kaleidoscope of sound, with so much to hear on so many levels.The beats are still there - it's like nothing has changed since '97 - but what Daft Punk seem to have done on \"Discovery\" for the most part is incorporate all the sounds from their childhoods (the 80's) into these tracks. That means vocoders, heavy metal guitar soloing, FM Rock keyboard sounds, computer game sounds, all stuck together with huge disco beats.Starting with the single and opening track \"One More Time\", you get 14 pieces of funk without the slightly annoying interludes featured on \"Homework\". In fact, the only slightly interlude-ish song here is \"Nightvision\", and even that sounds like an 10cc / Chicago / Supertramp crossover.Best songs here are \"Digital Love\" (which sounds a bit like Buggles(!)), \"Harder Better Faster Stronger\" (the best use of vocoder I've ever heard) and probably \"Something About Us\", only because it's so different from anything they've done before: It sounds like an 80's funk ballad! Hello, Level 42?!You may have noticed that I've used the phrase \"80's\" a lot here. But don't be put off - this is still a very modern sounding album. In fact, it sounds amazing; the production level is very high here.So buy it basically. If you liked \"Homework\", \"Music Sounds Better With You\", and the whole Cassius / Air / French genre, you will love this.","rating":"5 stars","location":"http://www.amazon.com/Discovery-Daft-Punk/dp/B000059MEK","mm_name":"review","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"}],"bestseller_list_rank":{"title":"French Pop","location":"http://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/music/16269871/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_m_1_4_last","overall_rating":"#5","description":"Amazon.com: Daft Punk: Discovery: Music","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","mm_name":"amazon_list"},"companion_products":[{"main_images":[{"location":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41DwWFdG-rL._SL500_SR100,100_.jpg","mm_name":"image","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"}],"title":"Random Access Memories (Vinyl LP)","price":"$8.99","location":"http://www.amazon.com/Random-Access-Memories-Vinyl-LP/dp/B00C061HZY/ref=pd_sim_m_1?ie=UTF8&refRID=1QASW7DJY19YTKMCSF11","mm_name":"amazon_product","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"main_images":[{"location":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51SFkrRA8DL._SL500_SR100,100_.jpg","mm_name":"image","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"}],"title":"Homework","price":"$8.99","location":"http://www.amazon.com/Homework-Daft-Punk/dp/B000000WCV/ref=pd_sim_m_2?ie=UTF8&refRID=1QASW7DJY19YTKMCSF11","mm_name":"amazon_product","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"main_images":[{"location":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51bKzJUA2GL._SL500_SR100,100_.jpg","mm_name":"image","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"}],"title":"Alive 2007 (2LP 180 Gram Vinyl)","price":"$8.99","location":"http://www.amazon.com/Alive-2007-2LP-Gram-Vinyl/dp/B00PCGZS0E/ref=pd_sim_m_3?ie=UTF8&refRID=1QASW7DJY19YTKMCSF11","mm_name":"amazon_product","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"main_images":[{"location":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Ybv2a2ieL._SL500_SR100,100_.jpg","mm_name":"image","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"}],"title":"Alive 2007","price":"$8.99","location":"http://www.amazon.com/Alive-2007-Daft-Punk/dp/B000W9EOEC/ref=pd_sim_m_4?ie=UTF8&refRID=1QASW7DJY19YTKMCSF11","mm_name":"amazon_product","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"main_images":[{"location":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51wb7fJlLVL._SL500_SR100,100_.jpg","mm_name":"image","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"}],"title":"Kind of Blue (180g Vinyl)","price":"$8.99","location":"http://www.amazon.com/Kind-Blue-Vinyl-Miles-Davis/dp/B0041TM5OU/ref=pd_sim_m_5?ie=UTF8&refRID=1QASW7DJY19YTKMCSF11","mm_name":"amazon_product","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"main_images":[{"location":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51hAyw7svPL._SL500_SR100,100_.jpg","mm_name":"image","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"}],"title":"Alive 1997 [Vinyl]","price":"$8.99","location":"http://www.amazon.com/Alive-1997-Vinyl-Daft-Punk/dp/B00005NVT0/ref=pd_sim_m_6?ie=UTF8&refRID=1QASW7DJY19YTKMCSF11","mm_name":"amazon_product","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"}],"specifications":[{"name":"Audio CD","value":"Audio CD  (March 13, 2001)","mm_name":"specification","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"name":"Number of Discs:","value":" 1","mm_name":"specification","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"name":"Format:","value":" CD","mm_name":"specification","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"name":"Label:","value":" Parlophone","mm_name":"specification","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"name":"ASIN:","value":" B000059MEK","mm_name":"specification","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"name":"Average Customer Review:","value":"4.4 out of 5 stars","mm_name":"specification","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"name":"Amazon Best Sellers Rank:","value":" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#2,009 in Music (See Top 100 in Music)\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.zg_hrsr { margin: 0; padding: 0; list-style-type: none; }\n.zg_hrsr_item { margin: 0 0 0 20px; }\n.zg_hrsr_rank { display: inline-block; width: 50px; text-align: right; }\n\n\n\n    \n    #5 \n    in Music > Pop > Euro Pop > French Pop\n    \n    \n    #7 \n    in Music > Dance & Electronic > House\n    \n    \n    #16 \n    in Music > Dance & Electronic > Disco","mm_name":"specification","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"value":"#5 \n    in Music > Pop > Euro Pop > French Pop","mm_name":"specification","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"value":"#7 \n    in Music > Dance & Electronic > House","mm_name":"specification","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"value":"#16 \n    in Music > Dance & Electronic > Disco","mm_name":"specification","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"}],"download_status":"DOWNLOAD_DONE","mm_name":"amazon_product"}}

Like many here, I purchased this dress to wear to a wedding, which will have lots and lots of dancing, so it was important that I find something super comfortable, and this is it. It's so soft and unrestricting, and flowy cut is exactly what I wanted (I have kind of a big derriere). Also, this was my first one shoulder piece and I was very nervous about it because I have broad shoulders, but the cut is flattering and hits in all the right places. The length is great too (I'm 5'3\" and it hits a little above my knee). I couldn't be happier with this dress =)","rating":"is-5-stars","main_images":[{"location":"http://productshots3.modcloth.net/productshots/0151/7897/0b06720a5dfae1c6810151c68c1a6507.jpg?1423001085","mm_name":"image","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"}],"location":"http://www.modcloth.com/shop/dresses/midnight-sun-dress-in-navy","mm_name":"review","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Aimee\n      \n        12/11/11  1:07am","description":"While Iâ€™m sure that the last thing this dress needs is another raving review, here goes nothing. The Midnight Sun Dress is lovely, and it has quickly become one of my boyfriendâ€™s favorites! I even wore it for our anniversary dinner. I love how modest the top is. Sometimes, I feel that one shoulder dresses work against a full bust, revealing more than intended or making it hard to find a bra that works with the dress, but this is not true of the Midnight Sun Dress. As long as youâ€™ve got a supportive strapless bra, youâ€™re good to go, even at family functions where cleavage is frowned upon. My only concern would be the length of the dress. Iâ€™m only 5â€™3 and the dress was still about 2 inches above my knee. Additionally, the front of the dress can fall in strange ways, but a quick steam is all that is needed to get the wrinkles out. Last but not least, if youâ€™re between sizes like I am (small on top medium on bottom), opt for the larger size. This dress has a snug fit, and the larger size helps the material to fall better.","rating":"is-5-stars","main_images":[{"location":"http://productshots3.modcloth.net/productshots/0151/7897/0b06720a5dfae1c6810151c68c1a6507.jpg?1423001085","mm_name":"image","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"}],"location":"http://www.modcloth.com/shop/dresses/midnight-sun-dress-in-navy","mm_name":"review","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Mary-Clare\n      \n        07/09/11  8:25pm","description":"I love this dress.

I was upgrading from a 2600k on an MSI board with gen3 support. I've recently purchased 2 Gigabyte g1 970's and had a EVGA SC gtx 780 I wanted to keep for physx. The only way to get all 40 lanes(16/16/8) via CPU is a hex or octa core as far as I know(there are some mobo's that have onboard chips to help but I wanted to see the CPU take control). It was an incredibly tight fit for the graphics cards. I built this system for gaming so I don't really need the older pci slots on the board. I have many HD's and wanted the extra SATA III ports even if the Marvell controller has been bench tested at being slower than the Intel. I was able to transfer my 16gb memory kit from my old MOBO to keep my costs down as well. Board was a rev 1.1 with f20 bios. I very, very carefully installed all my components and turned on the switch. Windows spent about 5-10 minutes updating drivers and then voila I was up and running. So far I've had no problems. I love all the USB 3 ports and esata ports in the rear as well. The easytune software allowed to perform a gentle OC on my air cooled cpu.","rating":"5  eggs","main_images":[{"location":"http://images17.newegg.com/is/image/newegg/13-128-532-TS?$S100$","mm_name":"image","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"}],"location":"http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813128532","mm_name":"review","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Worse than Useless","description":"Pros: + It's specs look good+ I used to think Gigabyte was a good brand","rating":"1  eggs","main_images":[{"location":"http://images17.newegg.com/is/image/newegg/13-128-532-TS?$S100$","mm_name":"image","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"}],"location":"http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813128532","mm_name":"review","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Recent ones no good","description":"Pros: Lots of features, has been on the market for some time.","rating":"2  eggs","main_images":[{"location":"http://images17.newegg.com/is/image/newegg/13-128-532-TS?$S100$","mm_name":"image","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"}],"location":"http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813128532","mm_name":"review","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Joke","description":"Pros: Everything when it works.","rating":"1  eggs","main_images":[{"location":"http://images17.newegg.com/is/image/newegg/13-128-532-TS?$S100$","mm_name":"image","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"}],"location":"http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813128532","mm_name":"review","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Solid LGA2011 Motherboard","description":"Pros: Paired this board with a 4930K and haven't been happier.

{"league_champion":{"title":"Diana","epithet":"Scorn of the Moon","description":"An unyielding avatar of the moon's power, Diana wages a dark crusade against the sun-worshipping Solari. Though she once sought the acceptance of her people, years of futile struggle shaped her into a bitter, resentful warrior. She now presents her foes with a terrible ultimatum: revere the moon's light, or die by her crescent blade.Though she was born to the Solari, Diana's inquisitive nature set her apart from her brethren. She had always found solace and guidance in the night sky, and questioned the dominance of the sun in her society. The Solari elders responded to her challenges with only derision and punishment. Diana remained convinced, however, that if she could find evidence of the moon's power, the elders would listen to reason. For years, she studied Solari archives in solitude until she discovered an encoded message hidden in an old tome. This clue led her to a secluded valley on Mount Targon where she unearthed the hidden entrance to an ancient, sealed temple. Inside, among aging relics and faded murals, she found an ornate suit of armor and a beautiful crescent blade, both inscribed with sigils of the moon. Diana donned the armaments and returned to the Solari elders that night. She declared that the artifacts proved others had once worshipped the moon as she did. Her discovery of evidence challenging Solari dominion shocked the elders. To Diana's horror, they pronounced her a heretic and condemned her to death. As the elders prepared her for execution, Diana's anger and sorrow overwhelmed her desire for acceptance. She lifted her gaze to the sky, calling upon the moon for strength. Lunar power surged within her and she shattered her bindings. Raising her relic blade, she turned and slaughtered the elders. With the temple in ruins behind her, Diana resolved to destroy all those who would deny the power of the moon.''The sun does not reveal truth.

{"league_champion":{"title":"Caitlyn","epithet":"the Sheriff of Piltover","description":"One of the reasons Piltover is known as the City of Progress is because it has an extraordinarily low crime rate. This hasn't always been the case; brigands and thieves of all sorts used to find the city-state an ideal mark for plunder, primarily due to the valuable resources it imports to fuel its techmaturgical research. Some even theorize that it would have fallen long ago to the chaos of organized crime if not for Caitlyn, the Sheriff of Piltover. Born the daughter of a wealthy statesman and a pioneering hextech researcher, Caitlyn discovered her natural gift for investigation when, at age 14, her father was assaulted and robbed on his way home. She snuck out of her house that night with her father's rifle and tracked down the muggers from the crime scene. At first, her parents did their best to discourage her from such risky hobbies, but she was incorrigible. Wishing to protect her daughter in the only way she knew how, Caitlyn's mother began outfitting her with techmaturgical devices tailored to her sleuthing needs.Caitlyn quickly gained notoriety, both because she was single handedly defeating crime in Piltover and also because she soon developed into a ravishing beauty. She never backed down from a case or a challenge, and she was one of the sharpest shots in the city-state. Her services were soon requested by Demacia to help track down a mysterious outlaw who had begun committing high-profile heists. The bandit, who always left a card with an ornate 'C' at the scene of the crime, became Caitlyn's arch-nemesis. To this day, Caitlyn still searches for this cat burglar, and the chase has led her all across Valoran. She has joined the League to hone her skills and gain the influence necessary to track down the only quarry that has managed to evade her.''Go ahead, run.

That is only slightly below the previous record low, set in 2007, but with weeks still to go in the summer melting season, it is clear that the record will be beaten by a wide margin.","The National Snow and Ice Data Center, a government-sponsored research agency in Boulder, Colo., announced the findings on Monday in collaboration with NASA. The amount of sea ice in the summer has declined more than 40 percent since satellite tracking began in the late 1970s, a trend that most scientists believe is primarily a consequence of the human release of greenhouse gases.","“It’s hard even for people like me to believe, to see that climate change is actually doing what our worst fears dictated,” said Jennifer A. Francis, a Rutgers University scientist who studies the effect of sea ice on weather patterns. “It’s starting to give me chills, to tell you the truth.”","Scientific forecasts based on computer modeling have long suggested that a time will come when the Arctic will be completely free of ice in the summer, perhaps by the middle of the century. This year’s prodigious melting is lending credibility to more pessimistic analyses that that moment may come much sooner, perhaps by the end of this decade.","“It’s an example of how uncertainty is not our friend when it comes to climate-change risk,” said Michael E. Mann, a climate scientist at Pennsylvania State University. “In this case, the models were almost certainly too conservative in the changes they were projecting, probably because of important missing physics.”","Experts say that a powerful storm in the Arctic this month almost certainly contributed to the record by breaking up ice. But the record low would not have occurred, they say, if the ice had not been steadily contracting for the past several decades.","The pace of that decline seems to be accelerating. But scientists are somewhat cautious in their predictions, given that sea ice is prone to natural variability. They have only a 33-year record of careful satellite observations, and before that, only sketchy data from maps and other historical sources.","By itself, the melting of sea ice does not raise global sea levels, because the floating ice is already displacing its weight in seawater. But the sharp warming that is causing the sea ice to melt also threatens land ice, notably the Greenland ice sheet, which is melting at an increasing rate. Melting land ice does raise sea levels.","Already, the reduction in sea ice is altering weather patterns in the Arctic region, and perhaps beyond. It is putting stress on the ecology of the region and causing rapid erosion of shorelines that are now exposed to more vigorous waves.","The melting does, however, offer some potential benefits, including new shipping routes and easier access to oil and other mineral deposits. A rush is on to stake claims and begin mineral exploration in the Arctic.","The average temperature of the region is rising more than twice as fast as that of the earth as a whole, confirming a prediction first made in 1896: that increasing levels of carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels would have an especially large impact in the Arctic. One reason is that the white surface of the ice reflects a great deal of sunlight back to space, but the darker water and land exposed when the ice melts absorb more heat from the sun, which in turns leads to additional melting, more sunlight absorption and so on — a feedback loop that scientists call Arctic amplification.","Dr. Francis is one of a small group of climate scientists who argue that the decline of sea ice is already having consequences for weather in the Northern Hemisphere’s middle latitudes, including in the United States. She has published research suggesting that air circulation patterns are being altered in a way that favors more extremes, like heat waves and droughts.","Such ideas are not considered proven, but they are getting more attention as the weather careers from one extreme to another.","Every year, the surface of the Arctic Ocean freezes during the long, dark winter, with the extent of sea ice usually peaking in March. Until recent decades, a high proportion of the ice was thick enough to survive the summer. But scientists say the warming trend has reduced the ice to just a shell in many places. The means it can melt easily in the round-the-clock sunshine that strikes the highest latitudes in summer.","Said Walt Meier, a top scientist at the snow and ice center, “Parts of the Arctic have become like a giant Slushee this time of year.”"],"main_images":[{"location":"http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2012/08/28/science/28arctic/28arctic-superJumbo.jpg","mm_name":"image","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"}],"rich_media":{"title":"Sea Ice in Arctic Measured at Record Low - NYTimes.com","text_keywords":"Ice,Global Warming,Weather,Greenhouse Gas Emissions,National Aeronautics and Space Administration,Arctic Ocean,Arctic Regions","thumbnail":{"location":"http://www.nytimes.com/images/2012/08/28/science/28arctic/28arctic-thumbStandard-v2.jpg","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","mm_name":"image"},"description":"With weeks left to go in the melting season, scientists are investigating whether a decline of ice in the Arctic Ocean is contributing to extreme weather farther south.","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","mm_name":"rich_document"},"thumbnail":{"location":"http://www.nytimes.com/images/2012/08/28/science/28arctic/28arctic-thumbStandard-v2.jpg","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","mm_name":"image"},"rating":{"text_keywords":"Ice,Global Warming,Weather,Greenhouse Gas Emissions,National Aeronautics and Space Administration,Arctic Ocean,Arctic Regions","title":"Sea Ice in Arctic Measured at Record Low - NYTimes.com","thumbnail":{"location":"http://www.nytimes.com/images/2012/08/28/science/28arctic/28arctic-thumbStandard-v2.jpg","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","mm_name":"image"},"description":"With weeks left to go in the melting season, scientists are investigating whether a decline of ice in the Arctic Ocean is contributing to extreme weather farther south.","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","mm_name":"rating"},"download_status":"DOWNLOAD_DONE","mm_name":"nytimes"}}

{"tate_artwork":{"title":"Number 14","year":"1951","medium":"Oil paint on canvas","description":"By 1951, Pollock had achieved considerable success with his dripped and poured abstract painting, and was widely regarded as the leading young American artist. Perhaps fearing that he was reaching an impasse in his work, he embarked on a series of black and white paintings in which figures emerge, as they had in his early works. After rolling the canvas out on the floor, he would apply the paint - usually industrial enamel paint - with sticks and basting syringes, which he wielded ‘like a giant fountain pen’, according to his wife, Lee Krasner.","location":"http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/pollock-number-14-t03978","site_name":"Tate","main_images":[{"location":"http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T03/T03978_9.jpg","mm_name":"image","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"}],"authors":[{"title":"Jackson

{"tate_artwork":{"title":"Fountain","year":"1917, replica 1964","medium":"Porcelain","description":"Fountain is one of Duchamp's most famous works and is widely seen as an icon of twentieth-century art. The original, which is now lost, consisted of a standard urinal, laid flat on its back rather than upright in its usual position, and signed 'R. Mutt 1917'. The Tate's work is a 1964 replica and is made from glazed earthenware painted to resemble the original porcelain. The signature is reproduced in black paint. Fountain is an example of what Duchamp called a 'readymade', an ordinary manufactured object designated by the artist as a work of art. It epitomises the assault on convention and good taste for which he and the Dada movement are best known. \n\nThe idea of designating such a lowly object as a work of art came from a discussion between Duchamp and his American friends the collector Walter Arensburg and the artist Joseph Stella. Following this conversation, Duchamp bought an urinal from a plumbers' merchants, and submitted it to an exhibition organised by the Society of Independent Artists. The Board of Directors, who were bound by the constitution of the Society to accept all members' submissions, took exception to the Fountain and refused to exhibit it. Duchamp and Arensburg, who were both on the Board, resigned immediately in protest. An article published at the time, which is thought to have been written by Duchamp, claimed, 'Mr Mutt's fountain is not immoral, that is absurd, no more than a bathtub is immoral. It is a fixture that you see every day in plumbers' shop windows. Whether Mr Mutt with his own hands made the fountain has no importance. He CHOSE it. He took an ordinary article of life, placed it so that its useful significance disappeared under the new title and point of view - created a new thought for that object.' ('The Richard Mutt Case', The Blind Man, New York, no.2, May 1917, p.5.) \n\nLater in life Duchamp commented on the name of the alter ego he created for this work: 'Mutt comes from Mott Works, the name of a large sanitary equipment manufacturer. But Mott was too close so I altered it to Mutt, after the daily cartoon strip 'Mutt and Jeff' which appeared at the time, and with which everyone was familiar. Thus, from the start, there was an interplay of Mutt: a fat little funny man, and Jeff: a tall thin man ... I wanted any old name, And I added Richard [French slang for moneybags]. That's not a bad name for a pissotière. Get it? The opposite of poverty. But not even that much, just R. MUTT.' (quoted in Schwarz, p.649.) Duchamp's use of a false signature, 'R. Mutt', anticipates his adoption of the alter ego Rrose Sélavy a few years later (indeed, in a letter of the period Duchamp referred to Mutt as a woman). Some commentators have noted how the inverted urinal resembles a female body, and see this as reflecting the play with gender boundaries which was an important leitmotif of Duchamp's career.\n\nSoon after the 1917 exhibition, Duchamp took Fountain to be photographed by his friend, the photographer and gallery owner Alfred Steiglitz. Since the original was lost thereafter, this photograph (reproduced in Ades, p.129) became the basis for the later replicas. Altogether fifteen authorised replicas of Fountain were issued, one in 1951, 1953 and 1963 respectively and a further twelve in 1964. The Tate's version is number two in an edition of eight made by the Galleria Schwarz in Milan in October 1964. Four further examples were also made at this time, one for both Duchamp and Arturo Schwarz, and two for museum exhibition.  Duchamp signed each of these replicas on the back of the left flange 'Marcel Duchamp 1964'. There is also a copperplate on the base of each work etched with Duchamp's signature, the dates of the original and the replica, the title, the edition number and the publisher's name, 'Galleria Schwarz, Milan'. \n\nSophie HowarthApril 2000\n\nFurther Reading:William Camfield, Marcel Duchamp: Fountain, Houston 1989, reproduced pp.90, 141 Arturo Schwarz, The Complete Works of Marcel Duchamp,

{"newmuseum_exhibition":{"title":"\"Language, Drama, Source & Vision\"","description":"Language, Drama, Source, and Vision Organized by Lynn Gumpert, Ned Rifkin, and Marcia Tucker \"We have provided a comprehensive view of our origins and our history through an inaugural exhibition which has been drawn from the thirty-three shows we have conceived, mounted, and documented since the Museum was founded in January, 1977…As we began work on the inaugural exhibition, four distinct areas of investigation became immediately evident. A preoccupation with language as process, system and … [more]metaphor was discernible as a dominant aspect of many of these artists' works. The influence of theater, its various conventions and dramatic strategies, has also profoundly shaped the profile of art for more than a decade now. In addition, the omnipresence of the mass media in our society has engendered a seemingly ever-widening primary source, a cross cultural touchstone for today's artists. Finally, abstraction, the uniquely twentieth-century art phenomenon, continues to provide many artists with the challenge of exploring an inner vision for a viable mode of creative enterprise which emphatically eschews the world of concrete imagery and objects.\" Language, Drama, Source, and Vision brochure. “The New Museum’s inaugural exhibition in its new home traced critical changes in the attitude, intent, methodology and style of contemporary painting, sculpture, photography, video and performance pieces, and focused on four major themes: 1) The concern with language, either as an integral aspect of the work or as epistemological exploration; 2) The influence of theater, as a mode of presentation, a narrative structure and a dramatic event; 3) The importance of mass media, including television, newspapers, film, and advertising as a major source of imagery and method in contemporary art.; 4) Works of art in a nonobjective mode, which explore issues by means of visual metaphor, abstraction ors systemic analysis. The work of approximately fifty artist was presented, selected from the over 300 artist whose work had been exhibited at The New Museum or been included in Art Quest studio tours, and Arts Updated lecture series. This exhibition provided both an overview of the Museum’s exhibition activity in its six-year history and, more importantly, a review of some of the crucial concerns that have characterized the art of our own time.”","location":"http://archive.newmuseum.org/index.php/Detail/Occurrence/Show/occurrence_id/67","contributors":[{"title":"Vito Acconci","location":"http://archive.newmuseum.org/index.php/Detail/Entity/Show/entity_id/13","mm_name":"artist","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"John Baldessari","location":"http://archive.newmuseum.org/index.php/Detail/Entity/Show/entity_id/118","mm_name":"artist","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Douglas Davis","location":"http://archive.newmuseum.org/index.php/Detail/Entity/Show/entity_id/459","mm_name":"artist","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Eleanor Dube","location":"http://archive.newmuseum.org/index.php/Detail/Entity/Show/entity_id/527","mm_name":"artist","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Lauren Ewing","location":"http://archive.newmuseum.org/index.php/Detail/Entity/Show/entity_id/584","mm_name":"artist","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"John Fekner","location":"http://archive.newmuseum.org/index.php/Detail/Entity/Show/entity_id/596","mm_name":"artist","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Reverend Howard Finster","location":"http://archive.newmuseum.org/index.php/Detail/Entity/Show/entity_id/607","mm_name":"artist","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Vernon Fisher","location":"http://archive.newmuseum.org/index.php/Detail/Entity/Show/entity_id/611","mm_name":"artist","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Alfred Jensen","location":"http://archive.newmuseum.org/index.php/Detail/Entity/Show/entity_id/939","mm_name":"artist","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Brad Melamed","location":"http://archive.newmuseum.org/index.php/Detail/Entity/Show/entity_id/1276","mm_name":"artist","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Claire Moore","location":"http://archive.newmuseum.org/index.php/Detail/Entity/Show/entity_id/1339","mm_name":"artist","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Adrian Piper","location":"http://archive.newmuseum.org/index.php/Detail/Entity/Show/entity_id/1523","mm_name":"artist","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Earl Ripling","location":"http://archive.newmuseum.org/index.php/Detail/Entity/Show/entity_id/1579","mm_name":"artist","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Allen Ruppersberg","location":"http://archive.newmuseum.org/index.php/Detail/Entity/Show/entity_id/1646","mm_name":"artist","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Ed Ruscha","location":"http://archive.newmuseum.org/index.php/Detail/Entity/Show/entity_id/1647","mm_name":"artist","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Irvin Tepper","location":"http://archive.newmuseum.org/index.php/Detail/Entity/Show/entity_id/1897","mm_name":"artist","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Anne Turyn","location":"http://archive.newmuseum.org/index.php/Detail/Entity/Show/entity_id/1951","mm_name":"artist","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Lawrence Weiner","location":"http://archive.newmuseum.org/index.php/Detail/Entity/Show/entity_id/2027","mm_name":"artist","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"William T.

{"rhizome_collection":{"title":"Formalism & Glitch","description":"This collection presents a wide range of works from the ArtBase that fall within the broad spectrum of artistic practices that exploit the aesthetics and formal paradigms inherent both in ubiquitous commercial software and home-brew computing. Two particular creative modes are presented: A) works that embrace and highlight the aesthetics, formal elements, and graphical user interfaces inherent in vernacular software, and B) works that seek to subvert these paradigms. Works that fall within the first category explore the value and joy of the pixel, user interface elements, handcrafted HTML, and ASCII. Alexei Shulgin’s “Form Art”, or Maciej Wisniewski’s “Scroll Bar” take a distinctly pop / ready-made approach, appropriating and building with mundane elements of user interface.

Prior educational approaches have not successfully addressed these critical skills. The assumption has been that the highest fidelity simulations result in the best learning. Deploying high-fidelity simulations is expensive and dangerous; they do not address team coordination. Low-fidelity approaches are ineffective because they are not stressful. Zero-fidelity simulation develops and invokes the principle of abstraction, focusing on human-information and human-human transfers of meaning, to derive design from work practice. Our principal hypothesis is that crisis responders will experience zero-fidelity simulation as effective simulation of team coordination. We synthesize the sustained iterative design and evaluation of the Team Coordination Game. We develop and apply new experimental methods to show that participants learn to cooperate and communicate, applying what they learn in practice. Design implications address how to employ the abstraction principle to develop zero-fidelity simulations.","favicon":{"meta_metadata_name":"image","location":"http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2063237&preflayout=flat","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},"authors":[{"meta_metadata_name":"acm_portal_author","location":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81309499161","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","title":"Zachary O.

{"ieee_article_body":{"location":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/icp.jsp?arnumber=1532126","title":"IEEE Xplore Full-Text HTML : Vizster: visualizing online social networks","sections":[{"location":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/icp.jsp?arnumber=1532126","paragraphs":["The advent of the Internet has given rise to many forms of online sociality, including e-mail, Usenet, instant messaging, blogging, and online dating services. In 2003, another form of online community acquired stunning popularity: online social networking services. In addition to descriptive personal profiles, members of such communities publicly articulate mutual “friendship” links with other members, creating a browseable network of social relations. Although pre-dated by other services such as sixdegrees.com in 1997, social networking services emerged as a veritable phenomenon with the dramatic rise of friendster.com, which rapidly amassed millions of users beginning in the spring of 2003. Friendster's success was closely followed by a number of other popular services, including Tribe.net and orkut.com, quickly earning these services the acronym “YASNS” or “Yet Another Social Networking Service.”","Though the users of these systems have constructed massive graph structures of social connectivity, typical web interfaces to these social networks remain relatively impoverished, showing only the network connections of single individuals in a linear list on a web page. Articulated connections between one's own “friends” in these systems are obscured, and can be unearthed only by paging through each friend's profile page. Higher level patterns of community can be even harder to discern. This has problematic implications for members' ability to explore their online community and gauge both the scale and the individuals to which their self-reported personal information is exposed.","In this paper we present the design of Vizster, a visualization system for exploring such online social networks. Vizster builds on ethnographic research of online social networking services and previous work in social network visualization to provide a system by which members of such online communities can explore their articulated social network in the playful manner that they desire. Our system is motivated by both social and technological concerns. On the social side, we attempted to better facilitate the discovery of people, connections, and communities to promote increased awareness of community structure and information exposure, while preserving (and hopefully enhancing) a fun and engaging online space. From a design perspective, this case study explores the mutually informing use of ethnographic techniques and visualization design to craft a domain-specific visualization system in a context as much characterized by play as by analysis.","Though the resulting system leverages existing techniques, these requirements resulted in a number of novel customizations and non-standard design decisions. Our design builds upon familiar node-link network layouts to provide novel techniques for visualizing graph inter-connectivity, supporting visual search and analysis of both network and profile data, customizing spring-embedded layouts, and automatically identifying and visualizing community structures. We have used the resulting system to visualize a 1.5 million member crawl of the popular Friendster service, collected in Winter 2003.","We first summarize related work in social network visualization and share relevant findings from an ethnographic investigation of the Friendster service. We then describe the design of the Vizster visualization in detail, followed by observations from a public installation and informal studies of the system's usage."],"title":"INTRODUCTION","mm_name":"sections","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"location":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/icp.jsp?arnumber=1532126","paragraphs":["Visualization of social networks has a rich history, particularly within the social sciences, where node-link depictions of social 33 relations have been employed as an analytical tool since at least the 1930s. Linton Freeman documents the history of social network visualization within sociological research, providing examples of the ways in which spatial position, color, size, and shape can all be used to encode information [8]. For example, networks can be arranged on a map to represent the geographic distribution of a population. Alternatively, algorithmically generated layouts have useful spatial properties: a force-directed layout can be quite effective for spatially grouping connected communities, while a radial layout intuitively portrays network distances from a central actor. Color, size, and shape have been used to encode both topological and non-topological properties such as centrality, categorization, and gender.","In recent years, such approaches have been effectively used in the analysis of domains such as e-mail communication [7], early online social networks [1], and co-authorship networks in scientific publications [16].   There are a number of systems for generating such social network visualizations and performing statistical analyses for the purpose of sociological research, such as UCINet [20], JUNG [12], and GUESS [2].","In addition to sociological research, there have been numerous social visualization projects intended for end-users rather than outside researchers. Though often utilizing techniques seen in analytical domains, these systems present users with visualizations of their own online social world; they are nonanonymous and often perceived with a sense of social place [10] different from more detached analytical environments. Nardi et al.'s ContactMap [15] uses spatial grouping and color to redundantly code community groups within a visualization of a user's e-mail contacts. TouchGraph (http://touchgraph.com) uses a force-directed layout to present a network visualization of users of the LiveJournal online community, allowing personal networks to be expanded or contracted by user interaction. BuddyZoo (http://buddyzoo.com) analyzes users' instant messaging (IM) buddy lists to present a static network visualization of their IM contacts. Mutton's PieSpy [14] provides real-time, dynamic visualization of inferred social networks of Internet Relay Chat participants. Viegas et al.'s PostHistory and Social Network Fragments systems [21] visualize personal e-mail archives in both calendar and network views, including rich support for temporal filtering. They found these systems—especially their use in tandem—to be particularly well suited as a memory aid for past contexts and contacts.","Despite this wealth of social network visualization, we believe there is still a need for new designs and techniques, especially as articulated social networks become increasingly common in web services for signifying various kinds of relationship. Visualization of profile attributes unique to online social networks is needed, and techniques for incorporating analytical tools within the simplified domain of end-user visualization may prove useful."],"title":"RELATED WORK","mm_name":"sections","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"location":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/icp.jsp?arnumber=1532126","paragraphs":["To better navigate the myriad design decisions we faced, we turned to an ethnographic study of the Friendster service.  The following is the result of a 9-month participant-observation during 2003, including interviews, qualitative surveys and focus groups with over 200 Friendster early adopters [4], [6].","Friendster was designed to be an online dating site, complete with profiles, demographic and interest driven search, and a private messaging system. What made Friendster unique was its articulated social networking component and testimonial feature. Users were asked to declare “friends” on the system whose pictures would also appear on the profile when the friends confirmed the relationship. Friends could write testimonials that would also appear on the profile. Both the friends and testimonials were intended to signal additional information about the person's character for those interested in dating the person. Yet, when the early adopters began to use the service, they did not view it as a dating service, but a site where they could gather and communicate with their friends, surf for entertaining profiles and explore public displays of identity and relationships [6].","Early adopters fell primarily into one of three identity groups: gay men, techies/bloggers, and Burners (people who attended the Burning Man art festival in Nevada every September). Each group had a different presentation aesthetic and their profiles conveyed the aspects of their identity most associated with the communities through which they joined the service. For example, Burners usually used their “Playa names” (the nickname they used at the festival), uploaded pictures of themselves at the festival and talked about their music tastes. Many early adopters had densely connected social groups, which aided Friendster's spread. As Friendster became more popular, the user population diversified. That said, the vast majority of users throughout 2003 were in their 20s, college-educated, politically liberal, and living in urban centers. Teenagers did join the service, reporting ages of 69 or 61 and 71 (16 and 17 inverted) because the site forbade users under 18. By marking their age this way, teen users were able to easily find each other. While the service began in the San Francisco Bay Area, its popularity quickly spread to Europe and to Singapore, Malaysia and the Philippines where it took off dramatically. New users primarily came through invitations from active users; thus, the user base represents the extended networks of early adopters.","When users joined the site, they were required to develop a profile that asked for demographic information (age, location, hometown) and a description of tastes (dating preferences, music, books, movies). Users typically created the profile based on the norms of the friends who invited them. As such, the network structure was also apparent in the profile norms of different groups. People regularly updated their profiles, adding new photos, changing tastes dependent on their friends and writing testimonials for their friends in order to encourage reciprocity.","Through ethnographic analysis, boyd [4] uncovered common social practices endemic to Friendster amongst early adopters. While dating did occur, most joined the service because all of their friends joined. Users began using the service by searching for friends and old friends, adding them to their network where appropriate. Because Friendster limited the visibility of profiles to four degrees (friends' friends' friends' friends), users were often motivated to connect to as many people as possible to expand their visibility. Friendster's design decision to list the most highly connected people on the front page further activated the competitive tendency to collect as many people as possible.","In addition to personal profiles, early adopters began creating fake profiles–“Fakesters”–to represent anything from famous media figures like Angelina Jolie to cities like New York, concepts like Love to everyday objects like Salt. Fakesters like Brown University helped connect people who attended that school while Fakesters like Homer Simpson helped connect fans of the TV character. The Fakesters increased the density of the network because they both helped friends find each other and connected new people through shared interests. The profiles created for Fakesters were often quite creative and motivated many users to surf for interesting profiles in a treasure-hunt fashion.","While most users surfed the network by clicking on the friends of other profiles, there was also a search tool available, which helped in finding friends by name and aided in finding potential dates or hookups. Users could also click on interests and find anyone with that interest marked.","While the majority of people used Friendster for social exploration and play, questionable practices were also present. Some users used Friendster to distribute drugs while others used the service to construct fraudulent profiles for public roasting through testimonials. Another problem that emerged was the colliding of networks normally kept apart–not everyone was prepared to expose their networks to both friends and colleagues."],"title":"FRIENDSTER DESCRIPTION","mm_name":"sections","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"location":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/icp.jsp?arnumber=1532126","paragraphs":["Our goal with Vizster was to build a visualization system that end-users of social networking services could use to facilitate discovery and increased awareness of their online community. We wanted to support the exploratory and playful aspects of Friendster while also giving users easier access to search and group patterns. While users regularly explored the network on Friendster, the linear format limited such explorations. This led us to develop richer network views and exploratory tools, while maintaining a local orientation. We also learned that the use of imagery was indispensable for identifying people and establishing a presentation of self, and so must play a central role in the visualization. In addition to helping support the current practices, we wanted to make sure that Vizster did not eliminate the data that helped users get a sense of people through their profiles. One example is the use of re-appropriated profile fields (e.g., inverting ages to identify teenagers) for coded communication within a sub-population. For this reason, we realized that we must make searchable profile data very present and accessible in the visualization. These goals position Vizster differently from traditional social network visualizations used as analysis tools by social science researchers. The following description includes the implications this approach has had for our design decisions, both in terms of presentation and the level of technical sophistication exposed by the visualization.","Vizster presents social networks using a familiar node-link representation, where nodes represent members of the system and links represent the articulated “friendship” links between them (Figures 1, 2). In this view, network members are presented using both their self-provided name and, if available, a representative photograph or image. The networks are presented as egocentric networks: networks consisting of an individual and their immediate friends. Users can expand the display by selecting nodes to make visible others' immediate friends as well. To the right of the network display is a panel presenting a person's profile. As discussed later, the profile panel also provides direct manipulation searches over profile text.","In pursuing this design, we chose to violate Shneiderman's mantra of “overview first, zoom and filter, then details-on-demand” [19], instead opting for a philosophy of “start with what you know, then grow.” An overview of the full network is inappropriate in this personal context, as the sheer scale obscures useful landmarks. Users of this system are familiar with their friends, some friends of friends, and various “celebrities.” Given a lack of a priori knowledge of the user's familiarity with their extended network, starting from an egocentric perspective not only carries less perceptual and computational burden, but guarantees the presence of readily identifiable landmarks for orienting the user: one's self and their immediate friends. From this base, users can selectively expand the network to explore their greater community."],"title":"VISUALIZATION DESIGN","mm_name":"sections","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"location":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/icp.jsp?arnumber=1532126","paragraphs":["Vizster was written in Java using the prefuse visualization toolkit [11], leveraging the toolkit's filtering, layout, rendering, and image management support. We also wrote extensions for database connectivity and to perform connectivity highlighting and linkage views. To support keyword search, we also integrated the Lucene search engine (http://lucene.apache.org) into the prefuse framework. Network and profile data for the visualization were collected using a custom web crawler and stored in a backing MySQL database. To support highlighting connectivity queries and faster expansion response times, 2nd order networks are loaded from the database upon expansion of nodes, though only the 1st order networks are immediately visualized. This brings increased memory requirements, but have not proved limiting. Source code (but not collected data) for the application is available from http://prefuse.sourceforge.net."],"title":"IMPLEMENTATION NOTES","mm_name":"sections","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"location":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/icp.jsp?arnumber=1532126","paragraphs":["To evaluate and further guide the design of our visualization, we observed usage in two environments: a public installation at a large party and an informal laboratory setting. While we were certainly interested in gauging Vizster's utility and usability, we were also interested in larger patterns of discovery—finding unknown people, connections, communities of relevance—and in people's social and affective reactions to the visualization.","Our first observation of usage was conducted around an interactive installation at a 500-person all-night event in San Francisco. Many of the party-goers included early adopters of the Friendster system, especially those affiliated with the Burning Man festival and tech culture. The installation consisted of an interactive kiosk and a projection of the visualization onto a large screen. Throughout the night, we observed usage of the system by over a hundred users, noting the reactions of users and onlookers.","We also observed usage in an informal laboratory setting. Participants consisted of 5 males and 1 female, all Friendster members in their early-to-late twenties. To maintain ecological validity, we did not provide users with any tutorials or prespecified tasks. Instead, we simply asked them to play with the system, explore it as they saw fit, and talk-aloud about their experiences as they did so. After 15 minutes of exploration, we then provided users with a one page reference to the various controls, to ensure that we could gauge user reaction to otherwise undiscovered features. After 10 more minutes of observation, we interviewed participants about their experience and opinions.","Usage, especially within the party setting, was routinely coupled with some form of social play—for example, games to see if one could hunt down specific people they knew. Onlookers tended to participate as well, engendering a shared experience around the visualization. Most users and observers began retelling stories about people, their relationships, and shared experiences. Users would also play with the various interactive features, often without pursuing a specific task. In particular, users enjoyed zooming navigation and experimenting with the real-time layout, whether dragging items around to tease clusters apart or dragging items to build up spring tensions and then gleefully watch the recoil of the network upon release.","Through experimentation, most party-goers and study participants quickly made sense of the connectivity highlighting. Often times, a lone node would highlight far away from the current locus of interaction, eliciting comments such as “Why did that light up?” This would then trigger exploration, with users further expanding the network to discover the intermediary friends that were not yet visible. Users (or others also watching the visualization) would then answer their own question: “Oh, it's telling you that they are connected in some way.”","Similarly, users in both observation contexts enjoyed experimenting with the community analysis. Users would play with the slider to get a feel for how the feature worked, and then settle with a configuration that “looked right” to them. Nearly everyone then began retelling stories about the various communities and their members. Prototypical comments included “Look, it found all the people from Harvard” and “It was smart enough to know not to group them together, they hate each other.” In general, people tended to impart a higher level of sophistication to the community analysis than is implemented; some remain convinced that it compares members' profile data. Though they often parameterized the analysis using the slider, users seemed to discount their own input into this semi-automatic process.","Users easily discovered the X-ray mode, often commenting on the results of their ad-hoc analyses (e.g., “What!? She's not single!”). It proved particularly powerful when coupled with searches, as users naturally specified conjunctive queries by running search queries on top of the X-ray state. As we expected, however, users in both contexts showed a strong preference for imagery for navigating the networks, for example saying “bring the pictures back” when they wanted to hunt for someone else.","The lab context also provided valuable feedback on various features. In particular, linkage views were introduced in response to early user requests for a means of quickly unearthing connections without expanding another network. However, we found that both linkage views and the ability to inflate nodes were not discovered through experimentation, though were appreciated after consulting the reference. One participant suggested adding mechanisms for opportunistically suggest features to users—an approach often successful in video games.","In all, we found that the visualization was used by users to both explore and play with their networks—expanding the network to quite large depths, performing visual analyses, and exploring community structures while simultaneously engaging in social narratives. Although more formal comparative and longitudinal studies would be required to more fully assess the utility of the individual features introduced, the engaged yet playful exploration and discovery we observed helps validate a number of our design decisions. As one study participant put it, “Friendster gives you your two hours of fun, and this doubles it.”"],"title":"USAGE OBSERVATION","mm_name":"sections","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"location":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/icp.jsp?arnumber=1532126","paragraphs":["This paper presents a case study of the design of Vizster, a visualization system for end-user exploration of online social networks.

Resulting techniques include connectivity highlighting and linkage views for viewing network context, X-ray mode and profile search for exploring member profile data, and visualization of inferred community structures. Observations of usage indicate that these features proved both useful and conducive to social engagement. In future work, we are interested in applying these techniques in a more traditional analytical context and conducting more rigorous evaluations.

In addition, the study investigated the moderating role of product-Web site congruency in determining the effects of the two forms of source credibility on banner ad effectiveness. The results showed that, while advertiser credibility had a significant impact on consumer responses to banner ads, Web site reputation was found to exert no significant influence. Specifically, advertiser credibility appeared to positively influence perceived credibility of and attitudes toward the banner ad, the advertised brand, and the intention to purchase the brand. More interestingly, the findings suggest product-Web site content congruence effects that are contingent on advertiser credibility. That is, the persuasiveness of a banner ad is enhanced when a highly credible company advertises a product that is congruent with the Web site content. However, such congruence effects are not found for a company of low credibility.","text_keywords":"advertiser credibility, banner advertising, product-Web site congruency, Web site reputation","location":"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/ref/10.1080/15332861.2012.689565#.VNK8hJ3IZv4","download_status":"DOWNLOAD_DONE","mm_name":"informa_world"}}

{"pubmed_article":{"title":"Posterior lumbar interbody fusion using compressive bone graft with allograft and autograft in the pyogenic discitis.","description":"AbstractSTUDY DESIGN: This is a retrospective study.PURPOSE: To evaluate the advantages and effects of posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) using allograft and posterior instrumentation in the lumbar pyogenic discitis, which are resistant to antibiotics.OVERVIEW OF LITERATURE: To present preliminary results of PLIF using a compressive bone graft with allograft and pedicle screw fixation in the lumbar pyogenic discitis.METHODS: Fifteen patients who had lumbar pyogenic discitis were treated by posterior approach from May 2004 to July 2008. The mean follow-up duration was 27.2 ± 18.68 months. The standing radiographs of the lumbar spine and clinical results were compared and analyzed in order to assess the bony union, the changes in the distance between the two vertebral bodies and the changes in the lordotic angle formed between the fused bodies immediately after surgery and at the final follow-up.RESULTS: Fifteen solid unions at an average of 15.2 ± 3.5 weeks after operation. The mean preoperative lordotic angle of the affected segments was 14.3 ± 15.1°, compared to 20.3 ± 12.3° after surgery and 19.8 ± 15.2° at last follow-up. For the functional result according to the Kirkaldy-Willis criteria, the outcome was excellent in 9, good in 5, fair in 1, and there were no poor cases. The average visual analogue scale score was decreased from 7.4 before surgery to 3.4 at 2 weeks postoperative.CONCLUSIONS: The main advantage in the procedure of PLIF using compressive bone graft with allograft and post instrumentation is early ambulation. We believe that this is another good procedure for patients with poor general condition because a further autograft bone harvest is not required.","text_keywords":"Discitis;Homologous transplantation;Lumbar spine;Posterior lumbar interbody fusion","location":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22439083","authors":[{"title":"An KC","location":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=An%20KC%5BAuthor%5D&cauthor=true&cauthor_uid=22439083","contact":{"title":"Posterior lumbar interbody fusion using compressive bone graft with...  - PubMed - NCBI","description":"Asian Spine J. 2012 Mar;6(1):15-21. doi: 10.4184/asj.2012.6.1.15.

{"pubmed_article":{"title":"IL-2 promotes the function of memory-like autoregulatory CD8+ T cells but suppresses their development via FoxP3+ Treg cells.","description":"AbstractIL-2 plays a critical role in both effector T-cell development and FoxP3(+) CD4(+)  Treg-cell homeostasis. A reduction in Il2 transcription results in impaired FoxP3(+) CD4(+)  Treg-cell recruitment and function, and accounts for the association between murine Il2 and type 1 diabetes (T1D). The progression of T1D elicits a disease-countering negative feedback regulatory loop that involves the differentiation of low-avidity autoreactive CD8(+)  T cells into memory-like autoregulatory T cells in a CD4(+)  Th-dependent manner. Since these auto-regulatory T cells express IL-2Rβ (CD122), we hypothesized that their development might also be regulated by IL-2. Here, we investigate the effects of differences in IL-2 expression on this autoregulatory subset. We show that decreased IL-2 production impairs the regulatory capacity of memory-like autoregulatory CD8(+) CD122(+)  T cells. Surprisingly, we also find that a reduction in IL-2 production capacity increases memory autoregulatory CD8(+)  T-cell formation indirectly, by decreasing the development and function of FoxP3(+)  Treg cells in nonobese diabetic mice. These results illustrate a complex homeostatic interplay between IL-2, CD4(+)  Th cells, FoxP3(+) CD4(+)  Treg cells and autoregulatory CD8(+)  T-cell memory whereby IL-2 controls the function of both Treg-cell subsets, but IL-2-potentiation of FoxP3(+) CD4(+)  Treg-cell function results in the suppression of CD4(+)  Th-cell activation and autoregulatory memory CD8(+)  T-cell formation.© 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

{"anandtech_review":{"title":"The Mac Pro Review (Late 2013)","author":"Anand Lal Shimpi","publication_date":"on December 31, 2013 3:18 PM EST","price":"$2999","location":"http://www.anandtech.com/print/7603/mac-pro-review-late-2013","sections":[{"title":"Pricing and Configurations","description":"The DIY PC route is still going to be more affordable. If we go the Ivy Bridge E route and opt for a Core i7-4930K, you get more cores than either of the options above for around $600 for the CPU. Adding in another $330 for a motherboard, $180 for 12GB of DDR3-1866 memory, $1400 for two W7000 GPUs and $220 for a fast SATA SSD (Samsung 840 Pro) we’re at $2730 for a configuration that would cost at least $3499 from Apple. That’s excluding case, PSU and OS, but adding another ~$350 takes care of that and still saves you some money. If you opt for Radeon HD 7870s instead of the W7000 you can knock another $1000 off of that total price. All of that being said, I don’t expect there to be a lot of cross shopping between DIY builders and those looking for a Mac Pro.","location":"http://www.anandtech.com/print/7603/mac-pro-review-late-2013","mm_name":"rich_document","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Setting Expectations: A Preview of What's to Come in Mobile","description":"The bigger takeaway from this is the following: the very same limited gains in CPU performance will eventually come to ultra mobile devices as well. It’s only a matter of time before those CPU curves flatten out. What that does to the smartphone/tablet market is a discussion for another day.","location":"http://www.anandtech.com/print/7603/mac-pro-review-late-2013","mm_name":"rich_document","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Plotting the Mac Pro’s GPU Performance Over Time","description":"The similarities between what I’m saying here about GPU performance and AMD’s mantra over the past few years aren’t lost. The key difference between Apple’s approach and those of every other GPU company is that Apple spends handsomely to ensure it has close to the best single threaded CPU performance as well as the best GPU performance. This is an important distinction, and ultimately the right approach.","location":"http://www.anandtech.com/print/7603/mac-pro-review-late-2013","mm_name":"rich_document","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"CPU Choices","description":"If you want the best balance of heavily threaded performance without sacrificing performance in lighter workloads, the 8-core configuration seems to be the best bet. There are definitely bragging rights associated with the 12-core system, but unless you absolutely need a ton of cores you’re likely better suited by the 8-core configuration.","location":"http://www.anandtech.com/print/7603/mac-pro-review-late-2013","mm_name":"rich_document","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"CPU Performance","description":"There isn't much of an advantage to having 12 cores here, but the new Mac Pro does deliver an amazingly quick build time compared to anything else. The new Mac Pro is good for around a 24% improvement in build performance compared to the outgoing 12-core model.","location":"http://www.anandtech.com/print/7603/mac-pro-review-late-2013","mm_name":"rich_document","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Putting Mac Pro Performance in Perspective: Professional Apps","description":"It is really surprising just how big of an impact GPU performance can have on Final Cut Pro 10.1. It makes total sense that Apple went dual GPUs top to bottom with the new Mac Pro. It seems the latest version of Final Cut Pro was designed with the new Mac Pro in mind, which is unfortunate for anyone who was hoping to get by with an older Mac Pro with a far less capable GPU. It's very clear to me that the Mac Pro is really designed to be an upgrade on all fronts (CPU, GPU, SSD and external IO). The question is how many of those parts have existing Mac Pro users upgraded on their own. The answer to that will ultimately determine how big of a step forward the new Mac Pro really is.","location":"http://www.anandtech.com/print/7603/mac-pro-review-late-2013","mm_name":"rich_document","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Mac Pro vs. Consumer Macs","description":"Our Lightroom 3 export test tells a very similar story. Anyone with lighter workloads looking for a huge performance increase thanks to the Mac Pro will have to look elsewhere. The Mac Pro is at least performance competitive, but in these lightly threaded workloads you won't see a huge uplift.","location":"http://www.anandtech.com/print/7603/mac-pro-review-late-2013","mm_name":"rich_document","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"The PCIe Layout","description":"The part I haven’t quite figured out yet is how Apple handles DisplayPort functionality. All six Thunderbolt 2 ports are capable of outputting to a display, which means that there’s either a path from the FirePro to each Thunderbolt 2 controller or the PEX 8723 switch also handles DisplayPort switching. It doesn’t really matter from an end user perspective as you can plug a monitor into any port and have it work, it’s more of me wanting to know how it all works.","location":"http://www.anandtech.com/print/7603/mac-pro-review-late-2013","mm_name":"rich_document","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"GPU Choices","description":"Final Cut Pro’s division of labor between CPU and GPUs exemplifies what you’ll need to see happen across the board if you want big performance gains going forward. If you’re not bound by storage performance and want more than double digit increases in performance, your applications will have to take advantage of GPU computing to get significant speedups. There are some exceptions (e.g. leveraging AVX hardware in the CPU cores), but for the most part this heterogeneous approach is what needs to happen. What we’ve seen from FCP shows us that the solution won’t come in the form of CPU performance no longer mattering and GPU performance being all we care about. A huge portion of my workflow in Final Cut Pro is still CPU bound, the GPU is used to accelerate certain components within the application. You need the best of both to build good, high performance systems going forward.","location":"http://www.anandtech.com/print/7603/mac-pro-review-late-2013","mm_name":"rich_document","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Gaming Performance","description":"Metro is the one outlier in our test suite. Although CrossFire is clearly working under Windows, under Metro the D700 behaves as if it wasn't. I'm not sure what's going on here, but this does serve as a reminder that relying on multi-GPU setups to increase performance does come with a handful of these weird cases - particularly if you're using non-standard GPU configurations.","location":"http://www.anandtech.com/print/7603/mac-pro-review-late-2013","mm_name":"rich_document","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"4K Support","description":"","location":"http://www.anandtech.com/print/7603/mac-pro-review-late-2013","mm_name":"rich_document","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"The 4K Experience","description":"The rest of the 4K experience under OS X was pretty good. The PN-K321 display seemed far more compatible with the Mac Pro setup than the UP2414Q. Wake from sleep wasn't an issue the vast majority of the time. I did have one situation where I had to disconnect/reconnect the DisplayPort cable after the display wouldn't wake up.","location":"http://www.anandtech.com/print/7603/mac-pro-review-late-2013","mm_name":"rich_document","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"SSD","description":"I’m beyond pleased to see that Apple has moved its Mac lineup virtually top to bottom to PCIe SSDs.

{"rhizome_artist":{"title":"ui uuii","bio":"The most exotic of the Post-Impressionists, Ui Uuii was born in Paris in 1762. The son of a French journalist and a Peruvian woman, Ui Uuii spent his early childhood in Peru, attended a boarding school in France, and was a merchant seaman before becoming a stockbroker's assistant in 1871. At first merely an occasional painter represents the voice of a vast, ordinary world. Everyone seems to easily identify with his characters and the situations they find themselves in. He gives the twist of the ridiculous to everyday faults, foibles and successes and makes them a recognizable slice of life. Ui Uuii points out the humor in our lives, and in doing so, he touches our hearts. Because of this, his appeal is not restricted to any specific group. His qualities have endeared him to people from all walks of life. It is the fusion of these qualities that has resulted in television's biggest and most influential hit of the modern era. The show was credited by many for single-handedly resurrecting the sitcom genre. Ui Uuii's return to television after eight years was prompted by what he perceived as a lack of relevance and an abundance of superficiality in TV comedy programming. Ui Uuii frequented the Nouvelle Athenes Café where he met Pissarro and the Impressionists, whose works he purchased. He had married in 1873, and so it was not until ten years later that Ui Uuii decided to give up the business world and devote himself to the artistic. After a period in Rouen where he stayed with Pissarro, who had encouraged him, Ui Uuii met and had long discussions with Allan Kaprow, and he also met Claes Oldenburg, Jim Dine, Lucas Samaras and George Segal. He attended a number of early 'Happenings', but did not participate. After a lackluster apprenticeship, Ui Uuii went to Rome. By 1592, he was causing scandal, not only because of his volatile character and temper but because of his controversial painting methods. He rejected the lengthy preparations traditional in central Italy, preferring instead to work in oils directly from the subject - half-length figures and still life - as practiced by the Venetians. He aimed to make paintings that depicted the truth and he was critically condemned for being a naturalist. In spite of adverse reactions, Ui Uuii was commissioned to produce a number of large-scale paintings. However, certain of these after 1600 were made only to be rejected by patrons on the grounds of indecorum or theological incorrectness. His innovatory work nevertheless gained strong support and was a welcome antidote to Mannerism, or the limp compromises wrought by lesser artists working on religious themes. Supper at Emmaus is an example of Ui Uuii's virtuoso talent. Not only are the protagonists and the still life rendered equally with impeccable technique but the attitude of the apostles as they react to Christ is a remarkable interpretation. The circumstances and heightened emotion of the narrative are given further expression with dramatic chiaroscuro and powerful foreshortening. them actively. These contacts revived his interest in Pop imagery, and a more immediate stimulus was provided by a challenge from one of his sons, who pointed to a Mickey Mouse comic book and said; 'I bet you can't paint as good as that.' In 1961 Ui Uuii produced about six paintings showing characters from comic-strip frames, with only minor changes of color and form from the original source material. It was at this time that he first made use of devices which were to become signatures in his work - Ben-Day dots, lettering and speech balloons.

However, little did we realize that some of Spartan made the cut, in the form of an experimental rendering engine hidden under IE's hood. Microsoft has separated its Trident rendering engine into two separate versions: one is for Spartan, called EdgeHTML, while the other remains under its legacy naming with Internet Explorer. The reason Microsoft doesn't simply forego the older version is due to compatibility concerns. If you're running the Windows 10 9926 build, chances are good that you're automatically taking advantage of the new EdgeHTML engine in IE. To check, you can type 'about:flags' into the address bar. \"Automatic\" means that the non-Spartan Trident engine will be called-upon only if needed. In all other cases, you'll be taking advantage of the future Spartan web rendering engine. Performance-wise, the results with IE are like night and day in certain spots. Some of the improvements are significant. IE's Sunspider result already outperforms the competition, but it has been further improved. And with Kraken, the latency with the Spartan-powered Trident engine dropped 40%. Similar results are seen with a boost in the Octane web browser test as well.","mm_name":"SR","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"}},{"SR":{"author":"samzenpus","title":"Germany Plans Highway Test Track For Self-Driving Cars\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t90","location":"http://yro.slashdot.org/story/15/01/26/1658216/germany-plans-highway-test-track-for-self-driving-cars","description":"\"The German government wants to convert part of the A9 Autobahn in Bavaria into a test-field for advanced car technology.

Now the NYT reports on recent research on why some groups, like some people, are reliably smarter than others. In one study, researchers grouped 697 volunteer participants into teams of two to five members. Each team worked together to complete a series of short tasks, which were selected to represent the varied kinds of problems that groups are called upon to solve in the real world. One task involved logical analysis, another brainstorming; others emphasized coordination, planning and moral reasoning.  Teams with higher average I.Q.s didn't score much higher on collective intelligence tasks than did teams with lower average I.Q.s. Nor did teams with more extroverted people, or teams whose members reported feeling more motivated to contribute to their group's success. Instead, the smartest teams were distinguished by three characteristics (PDF). First, their members contributed more equally to the team's discussions, rather than letting one or two people dominate the group. Second, their members scored higher on a test called Reading the Mind in the Eyes, which measures how well people can read complex emotional states from images of faces with only the eyes visible. Finally, teams with more women outperformed teams with more men. It appeared that it was not \"diversity\" (having equal numbers of men and women) that mattered for a team's intelligence, but simply having more women. This last effect, however, was partly explained by the fact that women, on average, were better at \"mindreading\" than men. \n\nInterestingly enough, a second study  has now replicated the these findings for teams that worked together online communicating purely by typing messages into a browser . \"Emotion-reading mattered just as much for the online teams whose members could not see one another as for the teams that worked face to face. What makes teams smart must be not just the ability to read facial expressions, but a more general ability, known as \"Theory of Mind,\" to consider and keep track of what other people feel, know and believe.\"","mm_name":"SR","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"}},{"SR":{"author":"timothy","title":"Elon Musk's Proposed Internet-by-Satellite System Could Link With Mars Colonies\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t105","location":"http://science.slashdot.org/story/15/01/18/217259/elon-musks-proposed-internet-by-satellite-system-could-link-with-mars-colonies","description":"You have to hand it to Elon Musk, who has occasionally been referred to as a real life \"Tony Stark.\" The man helped to co-found PayPal and Tesla Motors.

The Meitivs say they believe in \"free-range\" parenting, a movement that has been a counterpoint to the hyper-vigilance of \"helicopter\" parenting, with the idea that children learn self-reliance by being allowed to progressively test limits, make choices and venture out in the world. \"The world is actually even safer than when I was a child, and I just want to give them the same freedom and independence that I had — basically an old-fashioned childhood,\" says Danielle. \"I think it's absolutely critical for their development — to learn responsibility, to experience the world, to gain confidence and competency.\" \n\nOn December 20, Alexander agreed to let the children walk from Woodside Park to their home, a mile south, in an area the family says the children know well.

Google also says that it'll have some 20 to 30 Ara modules available by launch across 10 different categories.","mm_name":"SR","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"}},{"SR":{"author":"samzenpus","title":"Google Aims To Be Your Universal Translator\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t122","location":"http://science.slashdot.org/story/15/01/14/1834250/google-aims-to-be-your-universal-translator","description":"\"Google is beaming a bit closer to Star Trek's universal translator with the newest edition of its Translate app. Rolling out over the next few days for iOS and Android users, the latest version of Google Translate offers two key features — the ability to instantly converse with someone speaking in a different language and the capability to translate street signs and other images into your native language. Both features have been available in the Android app to some extent. For example, Google Translate for Android has long offered real-time translation of conversations. But Google's goal behind the latest version of the app is to enhance and simplify the features so they work more quickly and fluidly without any lag time. The latest version of Google Translate aims to change that. To converse with someone speaking in a different language, a user chooses his language and that of the other speaker. He then taps the microphone icon in the app, starts speaking in his native or selected language, and then taps the mic icon again. The app will recognize which of the two languages is being spoken, and then the two speakers can carry on their conversation without having to keep tapping the mic. In a test of the app's instant translation, The New York Times said it did prove to be a step forward; though, it's not science fiction just yet. The app fared best with short sentences that didn't include jargon, and it worked better when the users paused between each translation. Google also has beefed up the app's ability to translate street signs. Previously, you'd have to take a photo of the foreign text to get a translation of it. Now, you simply point your camera at the sign and the translated text appears overlaid on your screen — even if you're not connected to the Internet. This feature is made possible courtesy of Quest Visual's Word Lens app for iOS and Android, which Google acquired when it purchased the company last May. This feature supports English translated to and from French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Russian and Spanish. Google says it's working to add more languages.\"","mm_name":"SR","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"}}],"favicon":{"location":"http://slashdot.org/favicon.ico","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","mm_name":"image"},"next_page":{"title":"Slashdot   (20)","favicon":{"location":"http://slashdot.org/favicon.ico","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","mm_name":"image"},"download_status":"UNPROCESSED","mm_name":"search"},"download_status":"DOWNLOAD_DONE","mm_name":"slashdot_search"}}

Nuon's father, Lao Liv, worked as a trader as well as a corn farmer, while his mother, Dos Peanh, was a tailor. An interview by a Japanese researcher in 2003 with Nuon Chea quoted that Liv was of Chinese ethnicity while Peanh was the daughter of a Chinese immigrant from Shantou and his Khmer wife,[7] while Chea had separately quoted that Liv was half-Chinese and Peanh was of pure Cambodian extraction during a trial proceeding in December 2011.[8] As a child, Nuon Chea was raised in both Chinese and Khmer customs. The family prayed at a Theravada Buddhist temple, but observed Chinese religious customs during the Lunar New Year and Qingming festival. Nuon Chea started school at seven, and was educated in Thai, French and Khmer.[7]","mm_name":"paragraph","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"text":"In the 1940s, Nuon Chea studied at Thammasat University in Bangkok and worked part-time for the Thai Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He began his political activities in the Communist Party of Siam in Bangkok.[9] He was elected Deputy General Secretary of the Workers Party of Kampuchea (later renamed as the Communist Party of Kampuchea) in September 1960.[10] In Democratic Kampuchea, he was generally known as \"Brother Number Two.\" Unlike most of the leaders of Khmer Rouge, Chea did not study in Paris.","mm_name":"paragraph","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"text":"As documented in the Soviet archives, Nuon Chea played a major role in negotiating the North Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia in 1970, with the intent of forcing the collapse of Lon Nol's government: \"In April–May 1970, many North Vietnamese forces entered Cambodia in response to the call for help addressed to Vietnam not by Pol Pot, but by his deputy Nuon Chea. Nguyen Co Thach recalls: \"Nuon Chea has asked for help and we have liberated five provinces of Cambodia in ten days.\" In 1970, in fact, Vietnamese forces occupied almost a quarter of the territory of Cambodia, and the zone of communist control grew several times, as power in the so-called liberated regions was given to the CPK [Khmer Rouge]. At that time relations between Pol Pot and the North Vietnamese leaders were especially warm.\"[11] The North Vietnamese trusted Nuon Chea more than Pol Pot or Ieng Sary, although he \"consistently and consciously deceived the Vietnamese principals concerning the real plans of the Khmer leadership.\" As a result, \"Hanoi did not undertake any action to change the power pattern within the top ranks of the Communist Party to their own benefit.\"[11]","mm_name":"paragraph","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"}],"mm_name":"section","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"CareerEdit","paragraphs":[{"text":"As the recently proclaimed state legislature, the Kampuchean People's Representative Assembly held its first plenary session during 11–13 April 1976, Chea was elected President of its Standing Committee. He briefly held office as acting Prime minister when Pol Pot resigned for one month, citing health reasons.[12] According to Dmitry Mosyakov, \"In October 1978, Hanoi still believed that \"there were two prominent party figures in Phnom Penh who sympathized with Vietnam—Nuon Chea and the former first secretary of the Eastern Zone, So Phim.\"....Vietnamese hopes that these figures would head an uprising against Pol Pot turned out to be groundless: So Phim perished during the revolt in June 1978, while Nuon Chea, as it is known, turned out to be one of the most devoted followers of Pol Pot—he did not defect to the Vietnamese side....It is difficult to understand why until the end of 1978 it was believed in Hanoi that Nuon Chea was \"their man\" in spite of the fact that all previous experience should have proved quite the contrary. Was Hanoi unaware of his permanent siding with Pol Pot, his demands that \"the Vietnamese minority should not be allowed to reside in Kampuchea\", his extreme cruelty, as well as of the fact that, \"in comparison with Nuon Chea, people considered Pol Pot a paragon of kindness\"?\"[11] Nuon Chea was forced to abandon his position as President of the Assembly, along with all others as the Vietnamese captured Phnom Penh in January 1979.","mm_name":"paragraph","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"text":"In December 1998 Chea surrendered as part of the last remnants of Khmer Rouge resistance which was based in Pailin near the Thailand border.[13] The government under Prime Minister Hun Sen, himself a former member of the Khmer Rouge, agreed to forsake attempts to prosecute Chea, a decision that was condemned by the international community.[14]","mm_name":"paragraph","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"}],"mm_name":"section","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Arrest and trialEdit","paragraphs":[{"text":"On 19 September 2007, Nuon Chea was arrested at his home in Pailin and flown to the Khmer Rouge Tribunal in Phnom Penh, which charged him with war crimes and crimes against humanity.[15] He has since been held in detention.","mm_name":"paragraph","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"text":"In February 2008, Chea told the court that his case should be handled according to international standards.

{"wikipedia_page":{"title":"Type system","description":"In programming languages, a type system is a collection of rules that assign a property called a type to the various construct—​such as variables, expressions, functions or modules—​that a computer program is composed of.[1] The main purpose of a type system is to reduce bugs in computer programs[2] by defining interfaces between different parts of a computer program, and then checking that the parts have been connected in a consistent way. This checking can happen statically (at compile time), dynamically (at run time), or it can happen as a combination of static and dynamic checking. Type systems have other purposes as well, such as enabling certain compiler optimizations, allowing for multiple dispatch, providing a form of documentation, etc.","location":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system","sections":[{"title":"Usage overview","mm_name":"section","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Fundamentals","mm_name":"section","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Type checking","mm_name":"section","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Polymorphism and types","mm_name":"section","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Specialized type systems","mm_name":"section","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Explicit or implicit declaration and inference","mm_name":"section","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Types of types","mm_name":"section","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Unified type system","mm_name":"section","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Compatibility: equivalence and subtyping","mm_name":"section","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Programming style","mm_name":"section","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"See also","mm_name":"section","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"References","mm_name":"section","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Further reading","mm_name":"section","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"External links","mm_name":"section","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"}],"categories":[{"title":"Type systems","location":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Type_systems","mm_name":"wikipedia_category_type","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Data types","location":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Data_types","mm_name":"wikipedia_category_type","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Program analysis","location":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Program_analysis","mm_name":"wikipedia_category_type","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Type theory","location":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Type_theory","mm_name":"wikipedia_category_type","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"}],"favicon":{"location":"http://bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","mm_name":"image"},"download_status":"DOWNLOAD_DONE","mm_name":"wikipedia_page"}}

{"ask_nature_product":{"title":"Air-trapping coating for ships, submarines","description":"Coating to reduce drag, increase bouyancy","explanation":"Researchers from the Nanoprobe Laboratory for Bio- and Nanotechnology and Biomimetics at Ohio State University are developing a biomimetic coating for use on ships and submersible aquatic vehicles. The purpose of their research is to mimic the air trapping ability of the water fern Salvinia molesta, an aquatic plant that traps air on the surface of its leaves. The research team has demonstrated microfabrication techniques that can be applied in various industries. These techniques can be used to produce materials that reduce drag in water by using a layer of air to repel surrounding water.A micropattern with comparable dimensions to the water fern hairs is created in the lab. The micropattern is treated with a hydrophobic (water-repelling) coating that is then stripped away to produce a new microstructure that is hydrophobic everywhere except on its tips. This development process mimics the water fern hairs by exhibiting a hydrophobic base and hydrophilic (water-attracting) tip. While it may seem counterintuitive to have a surface that attracts water while building underwater machinery, it is actually beneficial because it holds the water at a consistent distance from the material's surface. This results in an even surface that does not allow the water to interact with the larger surface area in between the microstructures. This layer of water also locks in air between the microstructures, providing buoyancy for objects in and under the water.","challenges_solved":"\"Air-retaining surfaces are of technological interest due to their ability to reduce drag when used for fluid transport, ship coatings and other submersible industrial products in which drag is a concern. Superhydrophobic surfaces have been utilized to obtain the desired air film for the previously stated applications, however the effect called 'giant liquid slip' has been shown to deteriorate the presence of such air films in a matter of minutes. Therefore, S. molesta’s unique ability to pin water and trap air is of importance in order to increase the durability and lifetime of air pocket formation for drag reduction in industrial use\" (Hunt and Bushan 2011: 187).","differences_from_existing_products":"Decreasing drag and increasing bouyancy of ships or submarines increases the efficiency of these vessels, reducing the amount of fuel required to power them.","text_keywords":"biomimicry, design, ask nature, biomimesis, function, janine benyus, biomimetics, architecture, biology, innovation, design, asknature","location":"http://www.asknature.org/product/9db08f87c7bb21d1cd485fb33f64ca50","main_images":[{"location":"http://www.asknature.org/images/uploads/product/9db08f87c7bb21d1cd485fb33f64ca50/wateronhairs.jpg.492x0_q85_cropsmart.jpg","mm_name":"image","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"location":"http://www.asknature.org/images/uploads/product/9db08f87c7bb21d1cd485fb33f64ca50/wateronhairs.jpg.492x0_q85_cropsmart.jpg","mm_name":"image","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"}],"inspiring_strategies":[{"title":"Leaf structure retains air layer underwater: water fern","location":"http://www.asknature.org/strategy/29db109b16deb3f57e6b99388b1d9884","text_keywords":"biomimicry, design, ask nature, biomimesis, function, janine benyus, biomimetics, architecture, biology, innovation, design, asknature","description":"Coating to reduce drag, increase bouyancy","mm_name":"ask_nature_strategy","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"}],"see_also":{"title":"Air-trapping coating for ships, submarines - AskNature","text_keywords":"biomimicry, design, ask nature, biomimesis, function, janine benyus, biomimetics, architecture, biology, innovation, design, asknature","description":"AskNature is the world's first digital library of Nature's solutions, organized by function, that can serve as an educational and cross-pollinating tool as well as a collaboration forum among biologists, engineers, designers and other innovators.","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","mm_name":"rich_document"},"favicon":{"location":"http://www.asknature.org/favicon.ico","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","mm_name":"image"},"download_status":"DOWNLOAD_DONE","mm_name":"ask_nature_product"}}

I have watched Megarhyssa ichneumon wasps drill through several centimetres of solid elm in order to parasitize the woodboring larvae of horntail wasps that feed deep inside dead trees. The parasite appears to detect the presence of horntails by smelling with its antennae and perhaps by feeling the larvae's vibrations in the wood. The ovipositor of Megarhyssa is longer than the wasp itself--it measures almost 10 centimetres--and is highly flexible. The wasp not only is able to insert the ovipositor through several centimetres of wood but also uses it to inject eggs into its horntail host.\" (Forsyth 1992:27)","application_ideas":"Application Ideas: Drilling mechanism for various substrates.","interested_indstrial_sectors":"Industrial Sector(s) interested in this strategy: Construction, mining","text_keywords":"biomimicry, design, ask nature, biomimesis, function, janine benyus, biomimetics, architecture, biology, innovation, design, asknature","location":"http://www.asknature.org/strategy/efd9f97ba5240b796b855c9bd5ee8397#.VLg7ryvIZv4","main_images":[{"location":"http://www.asknature.org/images/uploads/strategy/efd9f97ba5240b796b855c9bd5ee8397/370e177fbba77eee1afcbb9b8576d2ac.jpg","mm_name":"image","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"}],"inspiring_organism":{"scientific_name":"Ichneumonidae","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","mm_name":"ask_nature_organism"},"expert":{"name":"","affiliation":"","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","mm_name":"ask_nature_expert"},"biomimicry_taxonomy":{"group":{"title":"Move or stay put","location":"http://www.asknature.org/browse?selected=strategy|1&type=aof","text_keywords":"biomimicry, design, ask nature, biomimesis, function, janine benyus, biomimetics, architecture, biology, innovation, design, asknature","description":"AskNature is the world's first digital library of Nature's solutions, organized by function, that can serve as an educational and cross-pollinating tool as well as a collaboration forum among biologists, engineers, designers and other innovators.","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","mm_name":"ask_nature_group"},"subgroup":{"title":"Move","location":"http://www.asknature.org/browse?selected=strategy|1|6&type=aof","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","mm_name":"ask_nature_subgroup"},"function":{"title":"In/on solids","location":"http://www.asknature.org/browse?selected=strategy|1|6|16&type=aof","text_keywords":"biomimicry, design, ask nature, biomimesis, function, janine benyus, biomimetics, architecture, biology, innovation, design, asknature","description":"AskNature is the world's first digital library of Nature's solutions, organized by function, that can serve as an educational and cross-pollinating tool as well as a collaboration forum among biologists, engineers, designers and other innovators.","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","mm_name":"ask_nature_function"},"see_also":{"title":"Ovipositor drills through wood: parasitic wasps - AskNature","text_keywords":"biomimicry, design, ask nature, biomimesis, function, janine benyus, biomimetics, architecture, biology, innovation, design, asknature","description":"AskNature is the world's first digital library of Nature's solutions, organized by function, that can serve as an educational and cross-pollinating tool as well as a collaboration forum among biologists, engineers, designers and other innovators.","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","mm_name":"rich_document"},"text_keywords":"biomimicry, design, ask nature, biomimesis, function, janine benyus, biomimetics, architecture, biology, innovation, design, asknature","location":"http://www.asknature.org/strategy/efd9f97ba5240b796b855c9bd5ee8397#.VLg7ryvIZv4","title":"Ovipositor drills through wood: parasitic wasps - AskNature","favicon":{"location":"http://www.asknature.org/favicon.ico","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","mm_name":"image"},"description":"AskNature is the world's first digital library of Nature's solutions, organized by function, that can serve as an educational and cross-pollinating tool as well as a collaboration forum among biologists, engineers, designers and other innovators.","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","mm_name":"ask_nature_taxonomy"},"favicon":{"location":"http://www.asknature.org/favicon.ico","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","mm_name":"image"},"download_status":"DOWNLOAD_DONE","mm_name":"ask_nature_strategy"}}

{"ask_nature_strategy":{"title":"Mineral crystals enhance rasping power: chitons","description":"The radular ribbons with which chitons scrape algae from rocks have enhanced rasping power because they contain layers of magnetite crystals within a chitin matrix.","summary":"\"Many invertebrates use crystals of metal salts to harden their cutting, rasping, and grinding equipment. (Metal salts aren't, of course, metallic, in the mechanical or metallurgical sense, so they're not examples of metallic materials in nature.) For instance, the radular ribbons with which chitons (a group of mollusks) scrape algae from rocks contain layers of iron, as magnetite (Fe3O4), within a chitin (not chiton) matrix (van der Wal et al. 1989).\" (Vogel 2003:333)\"The major lateral teeth of the chiton Acanthopleura echinata are composite structures composed of three distinct mineral zones: a posterior layer of magnetite; a thin band of lepidocrocite just anterior to this; and apatite throughout the core and anterior regions of the cusp. Biomineralization in these teeth is a matrix-mediated process, in which the minerals are deposited around fibers, with the different biominerals described as occupying architecturally discrete compartments. In this study, a range of scanning electron microscopes was utilized to undertake a detailed in situ investigation of the fine structure of the major lateral teeth. The arrangement of the organic and biomineral components of the tooth is similar throughout the three zones, having no discrete borders between them, and with crystallites of each mineral phase extending into the adjacent mineral zone. Along the posterior surface of the tooth, the organic fibers are arranged in a series of fine parallel lines, but just within the periphery their appearance takes on a fish scale-like pattern, reflective of the cross section of a series of units that are overlaid, and offset from each other, in adjacent rows. The units are approximately 2 m wide and 0.6 m thick and comprise biomineral plates separated by organic fibers. Two types of subunits make up each 'fish scale': one is elongate and curved and forms a trough, in which the other, rod-like unit, is nestled. Adjacent rod and trough units are aligned into large sheets that define the fracture plane of the tooth. The alignment of the plates of rod-trough units is complex and exhibits extreme spatial variation within the tooth cusp. Close to the posterior surface the plates are essentially horizontal and lie in a lateromedial plane, while anteriorly they are almost vertical and lie in the posteroanterior plane. An understanding of the fine structure of the mineralized teeth of chitons, and of the relationship between the organic and mineral components, provides a new insight into biomineralization mechanisms and controls.\" (Wealthall et al. 2005:165)","application_ideas":"Application Ideas: Composite tools or machines for cutting (including on the nano- or micro-scales), more durable agricultural tools and implements.","interested_indstrial_sectors":"Industrial Sector(s) interested in this strategy: Nanotechnology, manufacturing, agriculture","text_keywords":"biomimicry, design, ask nature, biomimesis, function, janine benyus, biomimetics, architecture, biology, innovation, design, asknature","location":"http://www.asknature.org/strategy/b91cc7c16934434bb7c01ecbd8ad286c","main_images":[{"location":"http://www.asknature.org/images/uploads/strategy/b91cc7c16934434bb7c01ecbd8ad286c/28f00b97764d41c421fbf7e237218666.jpg","mm_name":"image","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"}],"inspiring_organism":{"scientific_name":"Acanthopleura","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","mm_name":"ask_nature_organism"},"expert":{"group":"Division of Science and Engineering","name":"David J.

Tomato water has nothing to hide from you except the depth of its flavor. \n                 \n                Remove these ads by\n          Signing UpStep 1: What You'll Need\n    if (typeof notesArray === \"undefined\")\n      window.notesArray = {};\n  \n- Ripe tomatoes (the riper they are, the better the flavor)\n- 3 layers or so of cheesecloth (or a thin and clean dish towel)\n- Large bowl/spoon/strainer\n- Pinch of salt\n* Aromatics (optional, but tasty)\n\nAnd of course, you'll need some time. \n\n\nStep 2: The Prep Step\n    if (typeof notesArray === \"undefined\")\n      window.notesArray = {};\n  <img class=\"photoset-photo\" alt=\"100_0231_1.JPG\" src=\"http://cdn.instructables.com/FGI/XDWW/H1EMHXZJ/FGIXDWWH1EMHXZJ.LARGE.jpg\" style=\"width:224px;\" /><img class=\"photoset-photo\" alt=\"100_0233_1.JPG\" src=\"http://cdn.instructables.com/F4N/BLGH/H1G700RU/F4NBLGHH1G700RU.MEDIUM.jpg\" style=\"width:365px;\" />\nSome recipes call for cooking your tomatoes and skinning them before this step, but for a cocktail or fresh soup base, I'd prefer the bright taste of raw/fresh tomatoes. If you'd prefer a deeper flavor for pasta or a richer dish, feel free to chop your tomatoes up and stew them until they turn a rich red color before proceeding. \n\n- Chop your tomatoes up. \nI suggest chopping them into a medium sized dice just for ease of processing, but it's up to you and your blender strength.\n\n- Add pinch of salt to taste, along with aromatics.\nNow would be the time to add lemongrass, pepper, garlic, lemon juice. Be creative here. I added a habanero for some spice.  \n\n- Add to your blender and blend!\nWe're looking for a puree consistency here, so it's pretty error-proof. \n\n\n« PreviousNext »View All Steps\n     \n\n    \n    <!--jqfx-->\n    <li class=\"ibleVersion\">\n        <div class=\"versionDetails\">\n\t    <span class=\"versionNumber\">\n\t        #<< versionNumber >>\n\t    </span>\n\t    <span class=\"versionLastSaved\">\n\t        saved <span class=\"strong\"><< timeElapsed >></span>\n\t    </span>\n\t    <span class=\"versionDateSaved\">(<< dateSaved >>)</span>\n\t</div>\n\t<div class=\"versionOptions\">\n\t    <a class=\"btn pull-right revertToVersion\"><< revertBtnTxt >></a>\n\t    <a class=\"btn pull-right showVersionPreview\"><< trans.PreviewVersion >></a>\n\t</div>\n    </li>\n\n\n<!--jqfx-->\n    <div id=\"ibleHistory\">\n        <h2>Version History</h2>\n\t<ul id=\"ibleVersions\">\n\t</ul>\n    </div>\n\n\n<!--jqfix-->\n    <div id=\"StepWrapperInternal\">\n        <div id=\"StepTrayContainer\">\n            <div id=\"stepListContainers\">\n                <!-- StepDetailView Manages this content -->\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <a id=\"StepDetailLeftButton\" href=\"#\"></a>\n    <a id=\"StepDetailRightButton\" href=\"#\"></a>\n\n\n<!--jqfix-->\n    <div class=\"stepDetailBox\">\n        <div class=\"imageTray\"></div>\n        <div class=\"TitleBodyBox\">\n            <div class=\"stepTitleWrapper\">\n                <input type=\"text\" class=\"stepTitleInput\" value=\"<< title >>\" placeholder=\"<< StepDecoratorText >> << trans.TypeTitlePrompt >>\"></input>\n            </div>\n            <br />\n            <br />\n\n            <div class=\"ck_wrapper\">\n                <textarea class=\"textEditor\" id=\"editor-<< unid >>\"><< body >></textarea>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n<!--jqfix-->\n    <ul id=\"InstructableVisible\">\n\n    </ul>\n\n\n<!--jqfix-->\n    <!-- 'li' container added in backbone view -->\n    <div class=\"DropAboveStepBar DropAsStepSibling\"><div class=\"dropHereMessage\"><< trans.DropAsNewStep >></div></div>\n    <div class=\" InstructableStep DropAsChild\">\n        <div class=\"wrapStepContent\">   <!-- this div must remain style-less and on its own.

I rather liked all the \"Twilight\" movies until now and this one is, to my personnal taste, as good as the previous ones - and even in one aspect a little bit better, as Edward and Bella finally become lovers. Below, you will find a short description of what I believe are the best elements of this film, with limited SPOILERS:1. Actors. All actors evolved as the serie continued and I believe they all got better with time. Robert Pattinson and Taylor Lautner are both excellent, but - in my humble opinion - it is Kristen Stewart who in this movie shines the most. Quite a lot of people frequently criticized her actorship claiming that she simply can not play at all and has a very limited assortment of expressions in her tool box. But for me, after reading \"Twilight\" books, this is how the character of Bella should be. I can hardly picture her wide smiling with all her teeth bared or doing any other highly extraverted things like that. In fact I believe that either by design or by accident Kristen Stewart got the things right about this character - her minimalistic approach to facial expressions actually makes (for me) Bella very believable and also quite likeable. In this part of the story, Bella takes a more dynamic approach to life by taking her destiny firmly under control. She makes important decisions and takes extreme risks, stubbornly resisting the opposite advice of all her family and friends - all of that in a deceptively unassuming way... And Kristen Stewart acted in the movie exactly as I pictured Bella did it, when I read the books. A very good job!Read more ›","rating":"5 stars","text_keywords":"Kristen Stewart, Robert Pattinson, Taylor Lautner, Bill Condon,The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1 (Two-Disc Special Edition),Summit Distribution,Movie,Mystery / Suspense / Thriller,Action-Fantasy,Drama / Romance,Pg13/2 DVD,Romance,Sci-Fi/Fantasy,Special ed.,Suspense/Thriller","mm_name":"review","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Above and Beyond Expectations","description":"Being a huge fan of the books and a pretty big fan of the movies, I was blown away at what a great job they did with this movie installment. I loved the visual and audio parallels they drew between the original movie, Twilight, and this movie. For instance (Spoiler Alerts throughout): I loved how they played Flightless Bird during the wedding ceremony and the way the camera circled them kissing in the same manner the camera circled E & B kissing at Prom at the very end of Twilight. It was a subtle, yet stunning way to visually tie the two movies together and really made more of an emotional impact than if they had just shot them straight on and plugged in a different song. That was genius. And that dress...gorgeous. Just as it was described in the book.I also loved that rather than having one continuous honeymoon \"consummation\" scene, they broke it up with Bella thinking about certain moments the next morning after looking in the mirror for the first time, where she's no longer a virgin. It was all done so tastefully. The way one's first time should be at that age. Not at some house party or in the back of some guy's car. For those who read the books and knew how Edward did everything he could to exhaust Bella with activities on their honeymoon so she'd be too tired to \"try again\", you have to admit that Bill Condon did such a great job showing you visually all the things they were doing without either character having to come out and say, I'm/you're trying to exhaust you/me. And it was adorable with KS put on her little nightgown and leaned against the wall...I got married when I was 19 and I felt the exact same way when I put on lingerie for the first time and dreaded walking into the bedroom with my little gown on.Read more ›","rating":"5 stars","text_keywords":"Kristen Stewart, Robert Pattinson, Taylor Lautner, Bill Condon,The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1 (Two-Disc Special Edition),Summit Distribution,Movie,Mystery / Suspense / Thriller,Action-Fantasy,Drama / Romance,Pg13/2 DVD,Romance,Sci-Fi/Fantasy,Special ed.,Suspense/Thriller","mm_name":"review","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Extended Material Makes the Movie More Complete","description":"Without giving away the added scenes they are a MUST for any Twilight lover!!!!... They are not really extended scenes but new scenes added in.  There is not longer version of the wolves running or such but whole new scenes that blend well with the movie. I think they should have been in the original cut.  Allot of films add in extra scenes that quite don't add to the film or slow it down but these added scenes for Part 1 really give the movie added punch!  I just loved watching the bonus scenes. It was also fun not knowing where they will show up so it almost like watching a new movie!...  Get this you won't regret it.I did get my copy on ebay where they had The Twilight Saga Complete Collection Box Set. It has all 5 movies on blu ray plus digital copies of all of them. Also it includes the audio commentary as an option!  And.... It has the Extended Edition of Breaking Dawn Part 1.....The Digital copies on the 5 Movie Box Set are on Cinema Now which is a great free app for storing movies where you can watch them on any device without taking up GB space on your device. They also download. At first I didn't think I would like Cinema Now compared to iTunes but then I saw my Blu Ray player had the option and I can watch my movies at a press of a button from Cinema Now. Its also available on SmartTvs. So it cool to have all the digital copies!

First off I notice major black light bleed out of the box & even after tweaking the TV on my own until I found the right settings from a other users.What I really like about this tv is that my playstation 3 is synced with the tv. My tv come's on when the playstation is turned on and I can control my ps3 with my Samsung remote nice feature.  The tv is nice a thin not very heavy. The 2d to 3d conversion is total crap some stuff looks good but for the most part it's a BIG gimmick. Movies & stuff filmed in 3D look amazing sometimes it's a hit & miss. So far my favorite 3d movies are : ( Monsters Vs Aliens ) ( avatar ) ( Despicable me )  Resident evil looked like crap & I really didn't like monster house. I am hoping the studios will improve 3D filming and make live action films pop out more. I tried some playstation 3 games in 3d I like the idea but WoW it really makes your eyes hurt after awhile.Setting up the tv was pretty easy I did found setting up the wireless on the Tv to be a real pain. I am pretty good with computers and wireless network it was still a pain. I have a netgear router and I was not able to link it with normal settings the tv kept saying my pass word was wrong password ended up doing the button method on my router and samsung tv. Right away the Tv found the router and no more issues.Now for the calibration settings that will make your set look amazing and reduce the famous Samsung clouding issue and black light bleeding which I couldn't stand until this !

After I changed the usage mode to 'home', it decreased considerably but was still noticeable.I visited some forums, websites, and some even advised to put pressure on the screen with my fingers (until I see the screen changing colors), etc, but nothing seemed to work.I decided to contact Samsung support and they advised me to change PICTURE MODE to 'STANDARD' and adjust the 'BACKLIGHT' to the value of '7'. The support guy/girl mentioned to leave this setting on for 3 weeks. After the three weeks, I should be able to change to any picture mode and to any value for the backlight. Finally, it was mentioned that if I did not see any changes, that a service ticket needs to be placed at this link (you will need to register your TV with Samsung): [...]I made the change today 4/15/2011 so I will wright another review within 3 weeks to let you know the end results.2) Sound stops working - I only have a PS3 and a DirecTV satellite box connected to the TV via HDMI cables (hight speed and 3D capable). I have noticed the TV produces no sound for like 1 second and then gradually comes back at a lower volume until it reaches the original volume.Read more ›","rating":"4 stars","text_keywords":"Samsung UN60D7000 60-Inch 1080p 240 Hz 3D LED HDTV, Silver [2011 MODEL] (2011 Model),Samsung,UN60D7000","mm_name":"review","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Great TV...

One of the best I seen so far.Internet connection is great on the TV. Very useful for watching Netflix.The qwerty remotes that came with my TV is very useful for web browsing, but don't expect the browser to be like normal computer browser because it is very bad, slow, hard to navigate, and cumbersome.For gaming, in my opinion, there is no lag if you turn off the picture enhancements options, and also turning on the game mode. I would say the lag on the TV would be probably somewhere between 30-50ms.3D is great! I watched Shrek 3D, and it's just stunning. A major improvement from last year model. I probably will buy Tron 3D, and see it on the TV soon.Cons: HDMI input is located on the side. Clouding & Flashlighting that can be seen in dark screen.Update: After 2 weeks of having the TV I noticed some flash lighting / clouding that can be seen in pitch black room. Not a big deal at first, but overtime I am starting to be annoyed by it. I am thinking of getting it exchange for higher end model. Therefore I am rating the TV 3/5 stars.

If it weren't for thrusting swords pointed at the audience, there would be no 3D content. But, in order to get the best picture today's technology has to offer, you have to buy the 3D feature. I hate the manufacturers for doing this to the public, but they have a lot of money riding on the success of 3D. Well, 3D ain't going to happen for them in any great numbers.I compared many big display TV's, but I kept returning to the D7000. It looked stylish and the picture was just outstanding. I had a salesman plug in a blu-ray player to several TV's and I fine tuned them all, but when all was said and done, the Samsung had that something extra than I could not quantify.  Two days later it was in my living room.The TV is slow to turn on. It is not instant-on. I hate that. There is only so much time you get in this life and using that precious time waiting for a TV to come is a waste. Samsung engineers need to do better. Anyway, give it at least five seconds for the picture to appear. When going online with the TV, another five or ten seconds are required. Tick. Tick.

My test Blu-Ray is HD Mood Aquarium and the colors from it just leaped from the screen.As I become more familiar with this model, I'll post updates on josephlcooke dot blogspot dot c0mBy intuition (the manual is in the TV's firmware and it stinks) you can fine tune the D7000 in more ways than you can imagine. Search the web for a PDF manual for 55\" D7000 to get an idea of this set's flexibility as the two have similar operational characteristics.Read more ›","rating":"5 stars","text_keywords":"Samsung UN60D7000 60-Inch 1080p 240 Hz 3D LED HDTV, Silver [2011 MODEL] (2011 Model),Samsung,UN60D7000","mm_name":"review","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"}],"companion_products":[{"title":"Samsung UN60F7100 60-Inch 1080p 240Hz 3D Ultra Slim Smart LED HDTV (2013 Model)","price":"$1,497.00","location":"http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-UN60F7100-60-Inch-1080p-240Hz/dp/B00BCGRQ7Q/ref=pd_sim_sbs_e_1?ie=UTF8&refRID=19BAPQ3122EJ5M04Q9YE","text_keywords":"Samsung UN60D7000 60-Inch 1080p 240 Hz 3D LED HDTV, Silver [2011 MODEL] (2011 Model),Samsung,UN60D7000","description":"Amazon.com: Samsung UN60D7000 60-Inch 1080p 240 Hz 3D LED HDTV, Silver [2011 MODEL] (2011 Model): Electronics","reviews_location":"#customerReviews","mm_name":"amazon_product","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Samsung UN65D8000 65-Inch 1080p 240 Hz 3D LED HDTV (Silver) (2011 Model)","price":"$1,497.00","location":"http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-UN65D8000-65-Inch-1080p-Silver/dp/B004Y45RXI/ref=pd_sim_sbs_e_2?ie=UTF8&refRID=19BAPQ3122EJ5M04Q9YE","text_keywords":"Samsung UN60D7000 60-Inch 1080p 240 Hz 3D LED HDTV, Silver [2011 MODEL] (2011 Model),Samsung,UN60D7000","description":"Amazon.com: Samsung UN60D7000 60-Inch 1080p 240 Hz 3D LED HDTV, Silver [2011 MODEL] (2011 Model): Electronics","reviews_location":"#customerReviews","mm_name":"amazon_product","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Samsung UN60ES8000 60-Inch 1080p 240Hz 3D Slim LED HDTV (Silver) (2012 Model)","price":"$1,497.00","location":"http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-UN60ES8000-60-Inch-1080p-Silver/dp/B0074FGTJA/ref=pd_sim_sbs_e_3?ie=UTF8&refRID=19BAPQ3122EJ5M04Q9YE","text_keywords":"Samsung UN60D7000 60-Inch 1080p 240 Hz 3D LED HDTV, Silver [2011 MODEL] (2011 Model),Samsung,UN60D7000","description":"Amazon.com: Samsung UN60D7000 60-Inch 1080p 240 Hz 3D LED HDTV, Silver [2011 MODEL] (2011 Model): Electronics","reviews_location":"#customerReviews","mm_name":"amazon_product","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Samsung UN60ES7500 60-Inch 1080p 240Hz 3D Slim LED HDTV (Black) (2012 Model)","price":"$1,497.00","location":"http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-UN60ES7500-60-Inch-1080p-240Hz/dp/B0077Y50JS/ref=pd_sim_sbs_e_4?ie=UTF8&refRID=19BAPQ3122EJ5M04Q9YE","text_keywords":"Samsung UN60D7000 60-Inch 1080p 240 Hz 3D LED HDTV, Silver [2011 MODEL] (2011 Model),Samsung,UN60D7000","description":"Amazon.com: Samsung UN60D7000 60-Inch 1080p 240 Hz 3D LED HDTV, Silver [2011 MODEL] (2011 Model): Electronics","reviews_location":"#customerReviews","mm_name":"amazon_product","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Samsung UN60F7500 60-Inch 1080p 240Hz 3D Ultra Slim Smart LED HDTV","price":"$1,497.00","location":"http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-UN60F7500-60-Inch-1080p-240Hz/dp/B00BCGROGE/ref=pd_sim_sbs_e_5?ie=UTF8&refRID=19BAPQ3122EJ5M04Q9YE","text_keywords":"Samsung UN60D7000 60-Inch 1080p 240 Hz 3D LED HDTV, Silver [2011 MODEL] (2011 Model),Samsung,UN60D7000","description":"Amazon.com: Samsung UN60D7000 60-Inch 1080p 240 Hz 3D LED HDTV, Silver [2011 MODEL] (2011 Model): Electronics","reviews_location":"#customerReviews","mm_name":"amazon_product","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Samsung UN60F8000 60-Inch 1080p 240Hz 3D Ultra Slim Smart LED HDTV (2013 Model)","price":"$1,497.00","location":"http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-UN60F8000-60-Inch-1080p-240Hz/dp/B00BCGRLX0/ref=pd_sim_sbs_e_6?ie=UTF8&refRID=19BAPQ3122EJ5M04Q9YE","text_keywords":"Samsung UN60D7000 60-Inch 1080p 240 Hz 3D LED HDTV, Silver [2011 MODEL] (2011 Model),Samsung,UN60D7000","description":"Amazon.com: Samsung UN60D7000 60-Inch 1080p 240 Hz 3D LED HDTV, Silver [2011 MODEL] (2011 Model): Electronics","reviews_location":"#customerReviews","mm_name":"amazon_product","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"}],"specifications":[{"value":"Sleep Timer","mm_name":"specification","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"value":"3D Compatiblity","mm_name":"specification","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"name":"Product Dimensions:","value":" \n    \n    13.8 x 54.3 x 34.9 inches ; 50.5 pounds","mm_name":"specification","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"name":"Shipping Weight:","value":" 71.3 pounds (View shipping rates and policies)","mm_name":"specification","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"name":"Shipping:","value":" This item can only be shipped to the 48 contiguous states.

It never forgets that, when viewed as a whole, these eight movies are a story of growing up, of the transition from childhood to adulthood. Of love and friendship and death. Because without those little funny and touching moments between the characters - if all you want is for the movies to rush from one plot element to another - then all you're left with is plot... and no story. Remember: plot is what happens TO the characters; story is what happens AS A RESULT of the characters.That's the real gorgeous beauty of these movies, and it's what will bring viewers back repeatedly to their DVD shelves. As Frodo said to Sam in `The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers': \"What are we fighting for Sam?\" \"That's there's still some good in this world,\" Sam replies, \"and that it's worth fighting for.\"That's why you need those little indulgent moments, because without them it's just razzle-dazzle special effects and set-pieces.

You do not get to keep the 'digital copy' as it expires after three years from when you register it.  It is currently impossible to download a physical digital copy without also putting Warner's Flixter application on your computer so they can DOCUMENT AND CONTROL your entire movie collection (if you read the terms, they also state that you may lose access to ANY of your movie content at anytime... even if it was not obtained through UV by installing this software).Read all the terms and conditions.  Read the privacy policy (or lack thereof) on Flixter and UV.It is all a scam.I wish studios would stop being stupid and just go with what works.  Get over the greed and try to look at things from your customers perspective for a change.  Studios will find they make A LOT more money when they stop fighting their customers and simply make good movies.All this does is push legitimate purchasers to piracy as an only

Initially it meant to serve me as a second laptop for occasional light work online, but very soon I realized that I was using it most of the time. My powerful Windows laptop and Mac mini were just sitting there collecting dust, getting my attention only once a week at best. I replaced my Samsung with Acer C720 2 GB RAM version two weeks ago.Here's a quick breakdown.- C720 has a slightly better screen than Samsung. Same washed out colors, but contrast and viewing angles are better, and so is brightness level. If you are spoiled by the screens of modern tablets, you might think that 1366x768 resolution would look unattractive. That's not quite right. I should remind you that MacBook's Air 11 screen has the same resolution and the same size. It's just enough to do what it's designed to do.- The keyboard layout of C720 may not be as good as Samsung's, but I like Acer's feel and key movement better. Unless you have very large hands, it might provide one of the best typing experiences in the price range below $300, and it's definitely better than most Windows laptops for that price. I write quite a lot and C720's keyboard didn't cause any significant discomfort so far. Touchpad is reasonably good, but nothing to be overexcited about. I only wish it was a bit larger.- C720 is WAY faster than Samsung. Don't be deceived by the name of the processor - this Celeron unit from the Haswell family has more processing power than Chrome OS requires. And 2 GB of RAM should be absolutely enough for anyone, who normally doesn't keep over a dozen tabs running heavy websites simultaneously. The fan would kick in from time to time, but it's very quiet and is never annoying.Read more ›","rating":"5 stars","text_keywords":"Acer C720 Chromebook (11.6-Inch, 2GB),Acer,C720-2848","mm_name":"review","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Inexpensive, lightweight and powerful. The C720 2GB version is one of the best buys in tech. Period.","description":"I'm a technology addict and I've been following the development of ChromeOS for a while. When it first came out, I totally understood the concept but wanted to wait for it to mature a while and the prices to come down. My trigger price point was $200 so when the 2GB version of C720 came out, I had to have one.I find it amazing that such an inexpensive device can do so much. After having it a week, it became my favorite machine just because it is so simple and light. After using it, you come to question why we need such big computing power, huge hard discs and RAM just to run a traditional OS when it comes to supporting the use cases for about 90% of what you use a PC to do. Whats even better, the Chromebook is pretty much ready to go out of the box, with an already pretty rich supply of online an offline apps don't cost you anything extra.Just like tablets came on the market and turned the PC industry upside down because they did 80% of a PC did, and did it with a better user experience, lower price with much less hardware spec. In the same way, I think the Chromebook will have a permanent place in personal tech as the one matching basic needs at the cheapest price - a second PC for around the home, or the \"throwaway\" unit for travel where you don't have to worry about damaging or losing it because its both cheap and highly secure.Specific to the C720 - I agree with most that the screen could be much better but it is still quite acceptable considering the price. The trackpad and the keyboard as well - I have no trouble using them and the trackpad is actually better than many more expensive PCs. I think the build quality is actually quite good - it looks professional and robust enough so that it can survive a road warrior's abuse.Read more ›","rating":"5 stars","text_keywords":"Acer C720

This is truly a fantastic album in every sense of the word.  And the techniques used in the creation were just fabulous.  One of the things my friend said when he first heard me playing it was \"the samples sound so CLEAN!\"  And they do.  Every sample has been processed at incredibly high quality, there is no \"Lo-Fi\" on this record.  The entire record is permeated with funky-style samples that you swear you know but just can't seem to place.  Every song has some fantastic SOMETHING about it:1.One More Time - the perfect party track! a thick thumping bassline and everybody-that's-not-a-raver's-view of the raver world lyrics -:)-, catches your attention immediately.2.Aerodynamic - by far, the most significant bit on this track is the squealing pseudo-guitar solo.  It may be simple, but it sounds REALLY COOL!3.Digital Love - early 80's motivational tapes samples with cheesy vocoded lyrics = something still meaningful?  To be honest, it's still fun to listen to, despite it's cheesiness.4.Harder, Better Faster, Stronger - one of my favorite songs on the record. Easy to dance to, but it features one of the most incredible things I've ever heard.  To understand you have to know what a vocoder is.  A vocoder is a device that takes your voice, specifically the vibrations in your voice, and converts it to the tone of the instrument it is attached to, which is almost ALWAYS a keyboard for simplicity.  What's really neat about Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger, is that at 2:25, the vocoder is switched over to an odd device that triggers it by a guitar.  It's especially obvious at certain points, where the player is playing a really neat solo.Read more ›","rating":"5 stars","text_keywords":"Daft Punk,Discovery,Parlophone,Discovery,Pop,Rock,Dance, DJ,Electronic,French","mm_name":"review","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Brilliant. Awesome. I'd like to play it \"One More Time\"","description":"Now this is interesting. Apparently these guys have been famous for quite a while, yet somehow I'd never heard of them. All that was remedied recently though. When I heard that Leiji Matsumoto had created a full-length animated feature with stunning animation based on an ablum by Daft Punk, I just had to check it out. While my opinion of that excellent piece of animation is mixed (I just didn't dig the story or think most of it matched the songs all that well), it did something to me. It made me buy the album it was based on \"Discovery\". Wow.In this case, it seemed more like the music video was just a distraction than an extension of the music. When I first started listening to the album I thought it was okay, but as I progressed through it, listening to the songs in order, and then repeating some just to hear them one more time, I got HOOKED.It's hard to describe. I love electronic music and techno and all that sort of thing, but this is different. The voices and music are all really just toyed with by the musical artists in these songs. Everything is just a way to get you into a feeling, of a rhythm, or a beat. The more you hear the songs, they more they grow on you, the more you get into them, the more you like them, the more you listen to them.Take that song \"One more time\". That song is downright addictive! The beat is so infectious that I found I absolutely had to move to the song while I was listening to it. Ditto for the next three tracks. \"Aerodynamic\" is amazing because it uses electric guitar like a piano player uses his keyboard, not just for show, but to extend and play with a melody, finally turning it into a music-box version of itself before transforming into my favorite song on the album \"Digital Love\". I love that song.Read more ›","rating":"5 stars","text_keywords":"Daft Punk,Discovery,Parlophone,Discovery,Pop,Rock,Dance, DJ,Electronic,French","mm_name":"review","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Brilliant CD! Best of the year so far.","description":"Let me start by saying this CD is really great!Its definitely Daft Punk's most 80's sounding release, but has a lot more to it than something like \"Darkdancer\" by Les Rhythm Digitales. Where that CD was very one sided, \"Discovery\" is a kaleidoscope of sound, with so much to hear on so many levels.The beats are still there - it's like nothing has changed since '97 - but what Daft Punk seem to have done on \"Discovery\" for the most part is incorporate all the sounds from their childhoods (the 80's) into these tracks. That means vocoders, heavy metal guitar soloing, FM Rock keyboard sounds, computer game sounds, all stuck together with huge disco beats.Starting with the single and opening track \"One More Time\", you get 14 pieces of funk without the slightly annoying interludes featured on \"Homework\". In fact, the only slightly interlude-ish song here is \"Nightvision\", and even that sounds like an 10cc / Chicago / Supertramp crossover.Best songs here are \"Digital Love\" (which sounds a bit like Buggles(!)), \"Harder Better Faster Stronger\" (the best use of vocoder I've ever heard) and probably \"Something About Us\", only because it's so different from anything they've done before: It sounds like an 80's funk ballad! Hello, Level 42?!You may have noticed that I've used the phrase \"80's\" a lot here. But don't be put off - this is still a very modern sounding album. In fact, it sounds amazing; the production level is very high here.So buy it basically. If you liked \"Homework\", \"Music Sounds Better With You\", and the whole Cassius / Air / French genre, you will love this.","rating":"5 stars","text_keywords":"Daft Punk,Discovery,Parlophone,Discovery,Pop,Rock,Dance, DJ,Electronic,French","mm_name":"review","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"}],"bestseller_list_rank":{"title":"French Pop","location":"http://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/music/16269871/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_m_1_4_last","overall_rating":"#3","text_keywords":"Daft Punk,Discovery,Parlophone,Discovery,Pop,Rock,Dance, DJ,Electronic,French","description":"Amazon.com: Daft Punk: Discovery: Music","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","mm_name":"amazon_list"},"companion_products":[{"title":"Random Access Memories (Vinyl LP)","price":"$8.99","location":"http://www.amazon.com/Random-Access-Memories-Vinyl-LP/dp/B00C061HZY/ref=pd_sim_m_1?ie=UTF8&refRID=1NJVYBJQNY32QD0P9ADK","text_keywords":"Daft Punk,Discovery,Parlophone,Discovery,Pop,Rock,Dance, DJ,Electronic,French","description":"Amazon.com: Daft Punk: Discovery: Music","reviews_location":"#customerReviews","mm_name":"amazon_product","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Homework","price":"$8.99","location":"http://www.amazon.com/Homework-Daft-Punk/dp/B000000WCV/ref=pd_sim_m_2?ie=UTF8&refRID=1NJVYBJQNY32QD0P9ADK","text_keywords":"Daft Punk,Discovery,Parlophone,Discovery,Pop,Rock,Dance, DJ,Electronic,French","description":"Amazon.com: Daft Punk: Discovery: Music","reviews_location":"#customerReviews","mm_name":"amazon_product","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Alive 2007 (2LP 180 Gram Vinyl)","price":"$8.99","location":"http://www.amazon.com/Alive-2007-2LP-Gram-Vinyl/dp/B00PCGZS0E/ref=pd_sim_m_3?ie=UTF8&refRID=1NJVYBJQNY32QD0P9ADK","text_keywords":"Daft Punk,Discovery,Parlophone,Discovery,Pop,Rock,Dance, DJ,Electronic,French","description":"Amazon.com: Daft Punk: Discovery: Music","reviews_location":"#customerReviews","mm_name":"amazon_product","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Human After All","price":"$8.99","location":"http://www.amazon.com/Human-After-All-Daft-Punk/dp/B0007DAZW8/ref=pd_sim_m_4?ie=UTF8&refRID=1NJVYBJQNY32QD0P9ADK","text_keywords":"Daft Punk,Discovery,Parlophone,Discovery,Pop,Rock,Dance, DJ,Electronic,French","description":"Amazon.com: Daft Punk: Discovery: Music","reviews_location":"#customerReviews","mm_name":"amazon_product","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Alive 2007","price":"$8.99","location":"http://www.amazon.com/Alive-2007-Daft-Punk/dp/B000W9EOEC/ref=pd_sim_m_5?ie=UTF8&refRID=1NJVYBJQNY32QD0P9ADK","text_keywords":"Daft Punk,Discovery,Parlophone,Discovery,Pop,Rock,Dance, DJ,Electronic,French","description":"Amazon.com: Daft Punk: Discovery: Music","reviews_location":"#customerReviews","mm_name":"amazon_product","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Alive 1997 [Vinyl]","price":"$8.99","location":"http://www.amazon.com/Alive-1997-Vinyl-Daft-Punk/dp/B00005NVT0/ref=pd_sim_m_6?ie=UTF8&refRID=1NJVYBJQNY32QD0P9ADK","text_keywords":"Daft Punk,Discovery,Parlophone,Discovery,Pop,Rock,Dance, DJ,Electronic,French","description":"Amazon.com: Daft Punk: Discovery: Music","reviews_location":"#customerReviews","mm_name":"amazon_product","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"}],"specifications":[{"name":"Audio CD","value":"Audio CD  (March 13, 2001)","mm_name":"specification","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"name":"Number of Discs:","value":" 1","mm_name":"specification","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"name":"Format:","value":" CD","mm_name":"specification","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"name":"Label:","value":" Parlophone","mm_name":"specification","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"name":"ASIN:","value":" B000059MEK","mm_name":"specification","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"name":"Average Customer Review:","value":"4.4 out of 5 stars","mm_name":"specification","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"name":"Amazon Best Sellers Rank:","value":" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#3,364 in Music (See Top 100 in Music)\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.zg_hrsr { margin: 0;

It's so soft and unrestricting, and flowy cut is exactly what I wanted (I have kind of a big derriere).

The Midnight Sun Dress is lovely, and it has quickly become one of my boyfriendâ€™s favorites! I even wore it for our anniversary dinner. I love how modest the top is. Sometimes, I feel that one shoulder dresses work against a full bust, revealing more than intended or making it hard to find a bra that works with the dress, but this is not true of the Midnight Sun Dress. As long as youâ€™ve got a supportive strapless bra, youâ€™re good to go, even at family functions where cleavage is frowned upon. My only concern would be the length of the dress. Iâ€™m only 5â€™3 and the dress was still about 2 inches above my knee. Additionally, the front of the dress can fall in strange ways, but a quick steam is all that is needed to get the wrinkles out. Last but not least, if youâ€™re between sizes like I am (small on top medium on bottom), opt for the larger size. This dress has a snug fit, and the larger size helps the material to fall better.","rating":"is-5-stars","text_keywords":"fashion-dress-4,a-line-casual-fashion-dresses,a-line-fashion-dresses,a-lines,best-seller-solids,best-sellers,blue-casuals,blue-solids,blues,casual-fashion-dresses,casual-solids,casuals,mid-length-casual-fashion-dresses,mid-length-fashion-dresses,solid-fashion-dresses,solids,blue,solid,ruffles,casual,a-line,one-shoulder,jersey,best-seller,ruching,cover-up,top-rated,summer,mid-length,good","mm_name":"review","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Jacque\n      \n        07/10/11  2:59pm","description":"Super comfortable!

I was upgrading from a 2600k on an MSI board with gen3 support. I've recently purchased 2 Gigabyte g1 970's and had a EVGA SC gtx 780 I wanted to keep for physx. The only way to get all 40 lanes(16/16/8) via CPU is a hex or octa core as far as I know(there are some mobo's that have onboard chips to help but I wanted to see the CPU take control). It was an incredibly tight fit for the graphics cards. I built this system for gaming so I don't really need the older pci slots on the board. I have many HD's and wanted the extra SATA III ports even if the Marvell controller has been bench tested at being slower than the Intel. I was able to transfer my 16gb memory kit from my old MOBO to keep my costs down as well. Board was a rev 1.1 with f20 bios. I very, very carefully installed all my components and turned on the switch. Windows spent about 5-10 minutes updating drivers and then voila I was up and running. So far I've had no problems. I love all the USB 3 ports and esata ports in the rear as well. The easytune software allowed to perform a gentle OC on my air cooled cpu.","rating":"5  eggs","text_keywords":"Newegg, Newegg.com,GIGABYTE GA-X79-UD3 LGA 2011 Intel X79 SATA 6Gb&#47;s USB 3.0 ATX Intel Motherboard","mm_name":"review","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Worse than Useless","description":"Pros: + It's specs look good+ I used to think Gigabyte was a good brand","rating":"1  eggs","text_keywords":"Newegg, Newegg.com,GIGABYTE GA-X79-UD3 LGA 2011 Intel X79 SATA 6Gb&#47;s USB 3.0 ATX Intel Motherboard","mm_name":"review","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Recent ones no good","description":"Pros: Lots of features, has been on the market for some time.","rating":"2  eggs","text_keywords":"Newegg, Newegg.com,GIGABYTE GA-X79-UD3 LGA 2011 Intel X79 SATA 6Gb&#47;s USB 3.0 ATX Intel Motherboard","mm_name":"review","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Joke","description":"Pros: Everything when it works.","rating":"1  eggs","text_keywords":"Newegg, Newegg.com,GIGABYTE GA-X79-UD3 LGA 2011 Intel X79 SATA 6Gb&#47;s USB 3.0 ATX Intel Motherboard","mm_name":"review","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Solid LGA2011 Motherboard","description":"Pros: Paired this board with a 4930K and haven't been happier.

All I have to say is so far so good...I have back and neck issues and this mattress really sincerely helps!  This mattress is exactly as pictured, I allowed it 1 full day to retain it's shape after unpacking, and it feels so good. The quality is the same a mattress that costs double. The delivery was very fast!\n\nYou have to purchase the memory foam according to your usage, environment and level of maintenance. I travel back and forth from one town to another for business, and some days, I am not actually sleeping on my bed. When I go back and forth from a firmer mattress to this one, I feel sore after sleeping on this one, I don't know why? The mattress is BEST the second day after my return and not the first??  AFTER THAT, it is like sleeping on a cloud that cradles you. With regular daily usage, the mattress is amazing\n  \nA couple things to consider with a memory foam mattress that I learned from family members and friends who own them:\n        * MEMORY FOAM can be HIGH MAINTENANCE, but well worth the investment\n        * How high does the mattress sit against your bed frame, headboard, etc.\n        * memory foam mattresses are better on a flat, hard surface for the best support. Box springs are ok, Bunkie boards are better, and a thick Plywood cut to the size of the bed and covered is the best apparently(advice from my brother who has a much higher end mattress than this one)...However, If you are considering one in the price range over $1000 like my folks invested in (over this one)--then you don't have to do squat!!  My brother actually stumbled on this theory after purchasing another competitors memory foam that started to lose its comfort after only 1 year. His wife insisted on purchasing another mattress. While they waited for the other one to arrive, they set their memory foam on their hardwood floor in a guest room and slept on it on the floor. They were shocked at how comfortable it was and are emphatically against box springs for memory foam now. The new mattress is now in the guest room.\n       * You must allow the memory foam to \"BREATHE\" so that you can maintain it's resilience (for med end and lower end- it makes no difference). You do not want the mattress to actually \"memorize\" your body contours or it won't support the body as well as when you first purchased the mattress. I remove the covers, unzip the mattress cover and open the windows to allow the mattress to truly aerate while I do laundry. \n       * Moisture/humidity/sweat is memory foams worst enemy. If you live somewhere humid, if your husband is sweaty or his gums spring a leak when he sleeps, if the master bed is close to the bathroom and you love steamy showers INVEST in a moisture proof cover.\n\nThis comes from family and friends with at least 7 years of memory foam mattress usage experience. Hope this helps someone.","rating":"4","site_name":"overstock.com","mm_name":"review","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Bodipedic","description":"We needed a relatively cheap and comfortable mattress before the holidays since my cat decided to ruin the one we had in our guest room. I couldn't believe what I found...a queen size memory foam mattress with decent reviews for a little over *** bucks, and, bonus, it's shipped right to your door!\n\nWhen it arrive, it was in a heavy cardboard box that was pretty easy to move into the guest room. The mattress was shrink wrapped, but not in the \"M\" way the enclosed instructions stated. No worries, it opened up easily, and took about a day to fully \"expand\" and that's about how long the funky foamy smell took to dissipate, too. I had to sleep on it the other day due to a migraine(it's in a dark room) and at first it was cool, then became warm with my body heat. Others have complained that this type of mattress gets too hot, but I thought it was comfortable and my back felt wonderful after sleeping on it. Also, it did NOT sag in the middle as one reviewer commented, and I'm \"big-boned\", if you catch my drift. The mattress is on the previous boxspring which seems to be doing a great job of supporting it. I would definitely recommend this...what could you lose for a little over *** bucks. Definitely a bargain.","rating":"5","site_name":"overstock.com","mm_name":"review","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Great item!","description":"When I first got this mattress I was a little nervous because it seemed firmer than I liked. But after setting it up and testing it out the first night, It was awesome. I slept better than I had in a long time! If you do want some very soft or plush like this is not for you. But I have some back and neck problems and this mattress curves perfectly to support them.

Amazing mattress","description":"After seeing the great price of this mattress while browsing the o.co iPad app, I had to take a further look, even though I wasn't really in the market for a mattress.\n\nI bought the mattress after reading over 90 positive reviews (yes, i read them all ;-)  I decided to buy the mattress, which was on a Tuesday.\nThe mattress arrived at my front door on Friday morning. Very FAST shipping.\n\nThe mattress came in a fairly small box considering this is a queen size. Inside the mattress was compacted within a sort of compression band, so I just lifted that onto the bed foundation. Then, I just cut down the side of the band with scissors, and watched as the bed immediately started expanding (it was folded in half lengthwise and then rolled into a cylinder shape).I  just had to pull out one side of the mattress to help it unfold and it expanded to fit the foundation. I have to admit it was pretty exciting to see a mattress do this.\n\nThe minor odor didn't take too long to air out w/ open windows, and it was tolerable.. not that strong in the first place.\nLaying on the bed for the first time was wonderful.. I can't tell a major difference between this and the much more expensive Tempurpedic/memory foam mattresses in stores.\n\nIt's feel just perfect.. not too soft, not too firm. You can feel your body adjust into perfect alignment. After sleeping on a coil mattress forever, my wife first admitted that although she did feel a little bit of a slight pain when first laying on it, it was only because her spine was not used to being aligned straight haha\n\nThis is a great mattress and if you are unsure about buying this mattress because its on the web and you can't try it out, GET IT. I heard the lectures from others about needing to try out mattresses before purchasing, but I am very glad I did. I saved A LOT of money on a mattress built just as great as the expensive brands. If you are looking for a memory foam mattress this is a GREAT choice.

{"league_champion":{"title":"Diana","epithet":"Scorn of the Moon","description":"An unyielding avatar of the moon's power, Diana wages a dark crusade against the sun-worshipping Solari. Though she once sought the acceptance of her people, years of futile struggle shaped her into a bitter, resentful warrior. She now presents her foes with a terrible ultimatum: revere the moon's light, or die by her crescent blade.Though she was born to the Solari, Diana's inquisitive nature set her apart from her brethren. She had always found solace and guidance in the night sky, and questioned the dominance of the sun in her society. The Solari elders responded to her challenges with only derision and punishment. Diana remained convinced, however, that if she could find evidence of the moon's power, the elders would listen to reason. For years, she studied Solari archives in solitude until she discovered an encoded message hidden in an old tome. This clue led her to a secluded valley on Mount Targon where she unearthed the hidden entrance to an ancient, sealed temple. Inside, among aging relics and faded murals, she found an ornate suit of armor and a beautiful crescent blade, both inscribed with sigils of the moon. Diana donned the armaments and returned to the Solari elders that night. She declared that the artifacts proved others had once worshipped the moon as she did. Her discovery of evidence challenging Solari dominion shocked the elders. To Diana's horror, they pronounced her a heretic and condemned her to death. As the elders prepared her for execution, Diana's anger and sorrow overwhelmed her desire for acceptance. She lifted her gaze to the sky, calling upon the moon for strength. Lunar power surged within her and she shattered her bindings. Raising her relic blade, she turned and slaughtered the elders. With the temple in ruins behind her, Diana resolved to destroy all those who would deny the power of the moon.''The sun does not reveal truth.

{"league_champion":{"title":"Caitlyn","epithet":"the Sheriff of Piltover","description":"One of the reasons Piltover is known as the City of Progress is because it has an extraordinarily low crime rate. This hasn't always been the case; brigands and thieves of all sorts used to find the city-state an ideal mark for plunder, primarily due to the valuable resources it imports to fuel its techmaturgical research. Some even theorize that it would have fallen long ago to the chaos of organized crime if not for Caitlyn, the Sheriff of Piltover. Born the daughter of a wealthy statesman and a pioneering hextech researcher, Caitlyn discovered her natural gift for investigation when, at age 14, her father was assaulted and robbed on his way home. She snuck out of her house that night with her father's rifle and tracked down the muggers from the crime scene. At first, her parents did their best to discourage her from such risky hobbies, but she was incorrigible. Wishing to protect her daughter in the only way she knew how, Caitlyn's mother began outfitting her with techmaturgical devices tailored to her sleuthing needs.Caitlyn quickly gained notoriety, both because she was single handedly defeating crime in Piltover and also because she soon developed into a ravishing beauty. She never backed down from a case or a challenge, and she was one of the sharpest shots in the city-state. Her services were soon requested by Demacia to help track down a mysterious outlaw who had begun committing high-profile heists. The bandit, who always left a card with an ornate 'C' at the scene of the crime, became Caitlyn's arch-nemesis. To this day, Caitlyn still searches for this cat burglar, and the chase has led her all across Valoran. She has joined the League to hone her skills and gain the influence necessary to track down the only quarry that has managed to evade her.''Go ahead, run.

That is only slightly below the previous record low, set in 2007, but with weeks still to go in the summer melting season, it is clear that the record will be beaten by a wide margin.","The National Snow and Ice Data Center, a government-sponsored research agency in Boulder, Colo., announced the findings on Monday in collaboration with NASA. The amount of sea ice in the summer has declined more than 40 percent since satellite tracking began in the late 1970s, a trend that most scientists believe is primarily a consequence of the human release of greenhouse gases.","“It’s hard even for people like me to believe, to see that climate change is actually doing what our worst fears dictated,” said Jennifer A. Francis, a Rutgers University scientist who studies the effect of sea ice on weather patterns. “It’s starting to give me chills, to tell you the truth.”","Scientific forecasts based on computer modeling have long suggested that a time will come when the Arctic will be completely free of ice in the summer, perhaps by the middle of the century. This year’s prodigious melting is lending credibility to more pessimistic analyses that that moment may come much sooner, perhaps by the end of this decade.","“It’s an example of how uncertainty is not our friend when it comes to climate-change risk,” said Michael E. Mann, a climate scientist at Pennsylvania State University. “In this case, the models were almost certainly too conservative in the changes they were projecting, probably because of important missing physics.”","Experts say that a powerful storm in the Arctic this month almost certainly contributed to the record by breaking up ice. But the record low would not have occurred, they say, if the ice had not been steadily contracting for the past several decades.","The pace of that decline seems to be accelerating. But scientists are somewhat cautious in their predictions, given that sea ice is prone to natural variability. They have only a 33-year record of careful satellite observations, and before that, only sketchy data from maps and other historical sources.","By itself, the melting of sea ice does not raise global sea levels, because the floating ice is already displacing its weight in seawater. But the sharp warming that is causing the sea ice to melt also threatens land ice, notably the Greenland ice sheet, which is melting at an increasing rate. Melting land ice does raise sea levels.","Already, the reduction in sea ice is altering weather patterns in the Arctic region, and perhaps beyond. It is putting stress on the ecology of the region and causing rapid erosion of shorelines that are now exposed to more vigorous waves.","The melting does, however, offer some potential benefits, including new shipping routes and easier access to oil and other mineral deposits. A rush is on to stake claims and begin mineral exploration in the Arctic.","The average temperature of the region is rising more than twice as fast as that of the earth as a whole, confirming a prediction first made in 1896: that increasing levels of carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels would have an especially large impact in the Arctic. One reason is that the white surface of the ice reflects a great deal of sunlight back to space, but the darker water and land exposed when the ice melts absorb more heat from the sun, which in turns leads to additional melting, more sunlight absorption and so on — a feedback loop that scientists call Arctic amplification.","Dr. Francis is one of a small group of climate scientists who argue that the decline of sea ice is already having consequences for weather in the Northern Hemisphere’s middle latitudes, including in the United States. She has published research suggesting that air circulation patterns are being altered in a way that favors more extremes, like heat waves and droughts.","Such ideas are not considered proven, but they are getting more attention as the weather careers from one extreme to another.","Every year, the surface of the Arctic Ocean freezes during the long, dark winter, with the extent of sea ice usually peaking in March. Until recent decades, a high proportion of the ice was thick enough to survive the summer. But scientists say the warming trend has reduced the ice to just a shell in many places. The means it can melt easily in the round-the-clock sunshine that strikes the highest latitudes in summer.","Said Walt Meier, a top scientist at the snow and ice center, “Parts of the Arctic have become like a giant Slushee this time of year.”"],"main_images":[{"location":"http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2012/08/28/science/28arctic/28arctic-superJumbo.jpg","mm_name":"image","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"}],"thumbnail":{"location":"http://www.nytimes.com/images/2012/08/28/science/28arctic/28arctic-thumbStandard-v2.jpg","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","mm_name":"image"},"download_status":"DOWNLOAD_DONE","mm_name":"nytimes"}}

{"getty_object":{"title":"The Stigmatization of St. Francis, and Angel Crowning Saints Cecilia and Valerian","description":"This folding altarpiece depicts Saint Francis receiving the stigmata on the left and an angel crowning Saints Cecilia and Valerian with floral wreaths on the right. Delphine de Signe, an aristocrat living at the court of Naples in the early 1300s, had sworn a vow of virginity. Despite this, a marriage was arranged between her and Elzéar de Sabran, also a member of the court. Elzéar was a deeply religious youth, and Delphine was able to convert him to chastity by recounting the legends of Cecilia and Valerian, early Christian martyrs who took a vow of celibacy for their spiritual beliefs. Although they suffered from family opposition, Delphine and her husband remained devoted to one another and honored their common vow. Since the unusual subject matter of the virgin saints would have held symbolic import and served as a model for Delphine and Elzéar's own marriage, Delphine may have been the first owner of this diptych. The couple belonged to the lay Third Order of the Franciscans, which explains the depiction of Saint Francis at the left.","location":"http://www.getty.edu/art/gettyguide/artObjectDetails?artobj=907","main_images":[{"location":"http://www.getty.edu/art/collections/images/m/00090701.jpg","mm_name":"image","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"location":"http://www.getty.edu/global/images/global_enlarge.gif","mm_name":"image","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"location":"http://www.getty.edu/global/images/interactive_zoomin.gif","mm_name":"image","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"location":"http://www.getty.edu/global/images/ghost.gif","mm_name":"image","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"}],"work_info":{"author_name":"Unknown","date_and_location":"Italian, Naples or Avignon, 1330s","medium":"Tempera and gold leaf on panel","dimensions":"12 5/16 x 9 in.","museum_code":"86.PB.490"},"download_status":"DOWNLOAD_DONE","mm_name":"getty_object"}}

{"tate_artwork":{"title":"Number 14","year":"1951","medium":"Oil paint on canvas","description":"By 1951, Pollock had achieved considerable success with his dripped and poured abstract painting, and was widely regarded as the leading young American artist. Perhaps fearing that he was reaching an impasse in his work, he embarked on a series of black and white paintings in which figures emerge, as they had in his early works. After rolling the canvas out on the floor, he would apply the paint - usually industrial enamel paint - with sticks and basting syringes, which he wielded ‘like a giant fountain pen’, according to his wife, Lee Krasner.","location":"http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/pollock-number-14-t03978","site_name":"Tate","main_images":[{"location":"http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T03/T03978_9.jpg","mm_name":"image","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"}],"authors":[{"title":"Jackson

{"tate_artwork":{"title":"Fountain","year":"1917, replica 1964","medium":"Porcelain","description":"Fountain is one of Duchamp's most famous works and is widely seen as an icon of twentieth-century art. The original, which is now lost, consisted of a standard urinal, laid flat on its back rather than upright in its usual position, and signed 'R. Mutt 1917'. The Tate's work is a 1964 replica and is made from glazed earthenware painted to resemble the original porcelain. The signature is reproduced in black paint. Fountain is an example of what Duchamp called a 'readymade', an ordinary manufactured object designated by the artist as a work of art. It epitomises the assault on convention and good taste for which he and the Dada movement are best known. \n\nThe idea of designating such a lowly object as a work of art came from a discussion between Duchamp and his American friends the collector Walter Arensburg and the artist Joseph Stella. Following this conversation, Duchamp bought an urinal from a plumbers' merchants, and submitted it to an exhibition organised by the Society of Independent Artists. The Board of Directors, who were bound by the constitution of the Society to accept all members' submissions, took exception to the Fountain and refused to exhibit it. Duchamp and Arensburg, who were both on the Board, resigned immediately in protest. An article published at the time, which is thought to have been written by Duchamp, claimed, 'Mr Mutt's fountain is not immoral, that is absurd, no more than a bathtub is immoral. It is a fixture that you see every day in plumbers' shop windows. Whether Mr Mutt with his own hands made the fountain has no importance. He CHOSE it. He took an ordinary article of life, placed it so that its useful significance disappeared under the new title and point of view - created a new thought for that object.' ('The Richard Mutt Case', The Blind Man, New York, no.2, May 1917, p.5.) \n\nLater in life Duchamp commented on the name of the alter ego he created for this work: 'Mutt comes from Mott Works, the name of a large sanitary equipment manufacturer. But Mott was too close so I altered it to Mutt, after the daily cartoon strip 'Mutt and Jeff' which appeared at the time, and with which everyone was familiar. Thus, from the start, there was an interplay of Mutt: a fat little funny man, and Jeff: a tall thin man ... I wanted any old name, And I added Richard [French slang for moneybags]. That's not a bad name for a pissotière. Get it? The opposite of poverty. But not even that much, just R. MUTT.' (quoted in Schwarz, p.649.) Duchamp's use of a false signature, 'R. Mutt', anticipates his adoption of the alter ego Rrose Sélavy a few years later (indeed, in a letter of the period Duchamp referred to Mutt as a woman). Some commentators have noted how the inverted urinal resembles a female body, and see this as reflecting the play with gender boundaries which was an important leitmotif of Duchamp's career.\n\nSoon after the 1917 exhibition, Duchamp took Fountain to be photographed by his friend, the photographer and gallery owner Alfred Steiglitz. Since the original was lost thereafter, this photograph (reproduced in Ades, p.129) became the basis for the later replicas. Altogether fifteen authorised replicas of Fountain were issued, one in 1951, 1953 and 1963 respectively and a further twelve in 1964. The Tate's version is number two in an edition of eight made by the Galleria Schwarz in Milan in October 1964. Four further examples were also made at this time, one for both Duchamp and Arturo Schwarz, and two for museum exhibition.  Duchamp signed each of these replicas on the back of the left flange 'Marcel Duchamp 1964'. There is also a copperplate on the base of each work etched with Duchamp's signature, the dates of the original and the replica, the title, the edition number and the publisher's name, 'Galleria Schwarz, Milan'. \n\nSophie HowarthApril 2000\n\nFurther Reading:William Camfield, Marcel Duchamp: Fountain, Houston 1989, reproduced pp.90, 141 Arturo Schwarz, The Complete Works of Marcel Duchamp,

{"newmuseum_exhibition":{"title":"\"Language, Drama, Source & Vision\"","description":"Language, Drama, Source, and Vision Organized by Lynn Gumpert, Ned Rifkin, and Marcia Tucker \"We have provided a comprehensive view of our origins and our history through an inaugural exhibition which has been drawn from the thirty-three shows we have conceived, mounted, and documented since the Museum was founded in January, 1977…As we began work on the inaugural exhibition, four distinct areas of investigation became immediately evident. A preoccupation with language as process, system and … [more]metaphor was discernible as a dominant aspect of many of these artists' works. The influence of theater, its various conventions and dramatic strategies, has also profoundly shaped the profile of art for more than a decade now. In addition, the omnipresence of the mass media in our society has engendered a seemingly ever-widening primary source, a cross cultural touchstone for today's artists. Finally, abstraction, the uniquely twentieth-century art phenomenon, continues to provide many artists with the challenge of exploring an inner vision for a viable mode of creative enterprise which emphatically eschews the world of concrete imagery and objects.\" Language, Drama, Source, and Vision brochure. “The New Museum’s inaugural exhibition in its new home traced critical changes in the attitude, intent, methodology and style of contemporary painting, sculpture, photography, video and performance pieces, and focused on four major themes: 1) The concern with language, either as an integral aspect of the work or as epistemological exploration; 2) The influence of theater, as a mode of presentation, a narrative structure and a dramatic event; 3) The importance of mass media, including television, newspapers, film, and advertising as a major source of imagery and method in contemporary art.; 4) Works of art in a nonobjective mode, which explore issues by means of visual metaphor, abstraction ors systemic analysis. The work of approximately fifty artist was presented, selected from the over 300 artist whose work had been exhibited at The New Museum or been included in Art Quest studio tours, and Arts Updated lecture series. This exhibition provided both an overview of the Museum’s exhibition activity in its six-year history and, more importantly, a review of some of the crucial concerns that have characterized the art of our own time.”","location":"http://archive.newmuseum.org/index.php/Detail/Occurrence/Show/occurrence_id/67","contributors":[{"title":"Vito Acconci","location":"http://archive.newmuseum.org/index.php/Detail/Entity/Show/entity_id/13","mm_name":"artist","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"John Baldessari","location":"http://archive.newmuseum.org/index.php/Detail/Entity/Show/entity_id/118","mm_name":"artist","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Douglas Davis","location":"http://archive.newmuseum.org/index.php/Detail/Entity/Show/entity_id/459","mm_name":"artist","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Eleanor Dube","location":"http://archive.newmuseum.org/index.php/Detail/Entity/Show/entity_id/527","mm_name":"artist","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Lauren Ewing","location":"http://archive.newmuseum.org/index.php/Detail/Entity/Show/entity_id/584","mm_name":"artist","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"John Fekner","location":"http://archive.newmuseum.org/index.php/Detail/Entity/Show/entity_id/596","mm_name":"artist","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Reverend Howard Finster","location":"http://archive.newmuseum.org/index.php/Detail/Entity/Show/entity_id/607","mm_name":"artist","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Vernon Fisher","location":"http://archive.newmuseum.org/index.php/Detail/Entity/Show/entity_id/611","mm_name":"artist","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Alfred Jensen","location":"http://archive.newmuseum.org/index.php/Detail/Entity/Show/entity_id/939","mm_name":"artist","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Brad Melamed","location":"http://archive.newmuseum.org/index.php/Detail/Entity/Show/entity_id/1276","mm_name":"artist","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Claire Moore","location":"http://archive.newmuseum.org/index.php/Detail/Entity/Show/entity_id/1339","mm_name":"artist","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Adrian Piper","location":"http://archive.newmuseum.org/index.php/Detail/Entity/Show/entity_id/1523","mm_name":"artist","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Earl Ripling","location":"http://archive.newmuseum.org/index.php/Detail/Entity/Show/entity_id/1579","mm_name":"artist","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Allen Ruppersberg","location":"http://archive.newmuseum.org/index.php/Detail/Entity/Show/entity_id/1646","mm_name":"artist","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Ed Ruscha","location":"http://archive.newmuseum.org/index.php/Detail/Entity/Show/entity_id/1647","mm_name":"artist","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Irvin Tepper","location":"http://archive.newmuseum.org/index.php/Detail/Entity/Show/entity_id/1897","mm_name":"artist","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Anne Turyn","location":"http://archive.newmuseum.org/index.php/Detail/Entity/Show/entity_id/1951","mm_name":"artist","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Lawrence Weiner","location":"http://archive.newmuseum.org/index.php/Detail/Entity/Show/entity_id/2027","mm_name":"artist","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"William T.

{"rhizome_collection":{"title":"Formalism & Glitch","description":"This collection presents a wide range of works from the ArtBase that fall within the broad spectrum of artistic practices that exploit the aesthetics and formal paradigms inherent both in ubiquitous commercial software and home-brew computing. Two particular creative modes are presented: A) works that embrace and highlight the aesthetics, formal elements, and graphical user interfaces inherent in vernacular software, and B) works that seek to subvert these paradigms. Works that fall within the first category explore the value and joy of the pixel, user interface elements, handcrafted HTML, and ASCII. Alexei Shulgin’s “Form Art”, or Maciej Wisniewski’s “Scroll Bar” take a distinctly pop / ready-made approach, appropriating and building with mundane elements of user interface.

{"informa_world":{"title":"An Examination of Effects of Credibility and Congruency on Consumer Responses to Banner Advertisements","description":"This study examined the effects of advertiser credibility and Web site reputation on consumer responses to banner advertisements. In addition, the study investigated the moderating role of product-Web site congruency in determining the effects of the two forms of source credibility on banner ad effectiveness. The results showed that, while advertiser credibility had a significant impact on consumer responses to banner ads, Web site reputation was found to exert no significant influence. Specifically, advertiser credibility appeared to positively influence perceived credibility of and attitudes toward the banner ad, the advertised brand, and the intention to purchase the brand. More interestingly, the findings suggest product-Web site content congruence effects that are contingent on advertiser credibility. That is, the persuasiveness of a banner ad is enhanced when a highly credible company advertises a product that is congruent with the Web site content. However, such congruence effects are not found for a company of low credibility.","text_keywords":"advertiser credibility, banner advertising, product-Web site congruency, Web site reputation","location":"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/ref/10.1080/15332861.2012.689565#.VLg-GSvIZv4","source":{"location":"http://www.tandfonline.com/loi/wico20","text_keywords":"advertiser credibility, banner advertising, product-Web site congruency, Web site reputation","title":"Taylor & Francis Online\n         :: An Examination of Effects of Credibility and Congruency on Consumer Responses to Banner Advertisements - Journal of Internet Commerce - Volume 11,\n        Issue 2","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","mm_name":"periodical"},"see_also":{"title":"Taylor & Francis Online\n         :: An Examination of Effects of Credibility and Congruency on Consumer Responses to Banner Advertisements - Journal of Internet Commerce - Volume 11,\n        Issue 2","text_keywords":"advertiser credibility, banner advertising, product-Web site congruency, Web site reputation","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","mm_name":"rich_document"},"rich_media":{"text_keywords":"advertiser credibility, banner advertising, product-Web site congruency, Web site reputation","title":"Taylor & Francis Online\n         :: An Examination of Effects of Credibility and Congruency on Consumer Responses to Banner Advertisements - Journal of Internet Commerce - Volume 11,\n        Issue 2","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","mm_name":"rich_document"},"rating":{"text_keywords":"advertiser credibility, banner advertising, product-Web site congruency, Web site reputation","title":"Taylor & Francis Online\n         :: An Examination of Effects of Credibility and Congruency on Consumer Responses to Banner Advertisements - Journal of Internet Commerce - Volume 11,\n        Issue 2","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","mm_name":"rating"},"download_status":"DOWNLOAD_DONE","mm_name":"informa_world"}}

{"jstor_article":{"title":"Anthropologies of the United States","description":"This article reviews recent research in sociocultural anthropology that has been conducted in and about the United States. I show that anthropologists of the United States have been concerned to locate the anthropological field in three ways: spatial investigations of region, community, and territory; epistemological and methodological projects of cultural critique and defamiliarization; and reconsideration of the place of Native North America in the anthropology of the United States. Emergent inquiry into settler colonialism and the politics of indigeneity has the potential to strengthen the anthropology of the United States by accounting for the ways that being a settler society structures all American lives.","location":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/25735112","pages":"18","year":"2010","authors":[{"title":"Jessica R.

{"pubmed_article":{"title":"Posterior lumbar interbody fusion using compressive bone graft with allograft and autograft in the pyogenic discitis.","description":"AbstractSTUDY DESIGN: This is a retrospective study.PURPOSE: To evaluate the advantages and effects of posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) using allograft and posterior instrumentation in the lumbar pyogenic discitis, which are resistant to antibiotics.OVERVIEW OF LITERATURE: To present preliminary results of PLIF using a compressive bone graft with allograft and pedicle screw fixation in the lumbar pyogenic discitis.METHODS: Fifteen patients who had lumbar pyogenic discitis were treated by posterior approach from May 2004 to July 2008. The mean follow-up duration was 27.2 ± 18.68 months. The standing radiographs of the lumbar spine and clinical results were compared and analyzed in order to assess the bony union, the changes in the distance between the two vertebral bodies and the changes in the lordotic angle formed between the fused bodies immediately after surgery and at the final follow-up.RESULTS: Fifteen solid unions at an average of 15.2 ± 3.5 weeks after operation. The mean preoperative lordotic angle of the affected segments was 14.3 ± 15.1°, compared to 20.3 ± 12.3° after surgery and 19.8 ± 15.2° at last follow-up. For the functional result according to the Kirkaldy-Willis criteria, the outcome was excellent in 9, good in 5, fair in 1, and there were no poor cases. The average visual analogue scale score was decreased from 7.4 before surgery to 3.4 at 2 weeks postoperative.CONCLUSIONS: The main advantage in the procedure of PLIF using compressive bone graft with allograft and post instrumentation is early ambulation. We believe that this is another good procedure for patients with poor general condition because a further autograft bone harvest is not required.","text_keywords":"Discitis;Homologous transplantation;Lumbar spine;Posterior lumbar interbody fusion","location":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22439083","authors":[{"title":"An KC","location":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=An%20KC%5BAuthor%5D&cauthor=true&cauthor_uid=22439083","text_keywords":"Discitis;Homologous transplantation;Lumbar spine;Posterior lumbar interbody fusion","description":"Asian Spine J. 2012 Mar;6(1):15-21. doi: 10.4184/asj.2012.6.1.15.

{"pubmed_article":{"title":"IL-2 promotes the function of memory-like autoregulatory CD8+ T cells but suppresses their development via FoxP3+ Treg cells.","description":"AbstractIL-2 plays a critical role in both effector T-cell development and FoxP3(+) CD4(+)  Treg-cell homeostasis. A reduction in Il2 transcription results in impaired FoxP3(+) CD4(+)  Treg-cell recruitment and function, and accounts for the association between murine Il2 and type 1 diabetes (T1D). The progression of T1D elicits a disease-countering negative feedback regulatory loop that involves the differentiation of low-avidity autoreactive CD8(+)  T cells into memory-like autoregulatory T cells in a CD4(+)  Th-dependent manner. Since these auto-regulatory T cells express IL-2Rβ (CD122), we hypothesized that their development might also be regulated by IL-2. Here, we investigate the effects of differences in IL-2 expression on this autoregulatory subset. We show that decreased IL-2 production impairs the regulatory capacity of memory-like autoregulatory CD8(+) CD122(+)  T cells. Surprisingly, we also find that a reduction in IL-2 production capacity increases memory autoregulatory CD8(+)  T-cell formation indirectly, by decreasing the development and function of FoxP3(+)  Treg cells in nonobese diabetic mice. These results illustrate a complex homeostatic interplay between IL-2, CD4(+)  Th cells, FoxP3(+) CD4(+)  Treg cells and autoregulatory CD8(+)  T-cell memory whereby IL-2 controls the function of both Treg-cell subsets, but IL-2-potentiation of FoxP3(+) CD4(+)  Treg-cell function results in the suppression of CD4(+)  Th-cell activation and autoregulatory memory CD8(+)  T-cell formation.© 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

These results illustrate a complex homeostatic interplay between IL-2, CD4(+)  Th cells, FoxP3(+) CD4(+)  Treg cells and autoregulatory CD8(+)  T-cell memory whereby IL-2 controls the function of both Treg-cell subsets, but IL-2-potentiation of FoxP3(+) CD4(+)  Treg-cell function results in the suppression of CD4(+)  Th-cell activation and autoregulatory memory CD8(+)  T-cell formation.© 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Huynh, , , Robert C. Miller , David R.

In this paper, we present Potluck, a Web user interface that let’s casual users—those without programming skills and data modeling expertise—mash up data themselves.Potluck is novel in its use of drag and drop for merging fields, its integration and extension of the faceted browsing paradigm for focusing on subsets of data to align, and its application of simultaneous editing for cleaning up data syntactically. Potluck also lets the user construct rich visualizations of data in-place as the user aligns and cleans up the data. This iterative process of integrating the data while constructing useful visualizations is desirable when the user is unfamiliar with the data at the beginning—a common case—and wishes to get immediate value out of the data without having to spend the overhead of completely and perfectly integrating the data first.A user study on Potluck indicated that it was usable and learnable, and elicited excitement from programmers who, even with their programming skills, previously had great difficulties performing data integration.prs.rt(\"abs_end\");KeywordsMash up; Drag and drop; Faceted browsing; Simultaneous editing; Ontology alignment; End-user programming; Semantic web; RDF1. IntroductionThe construction of a Web 2.0 mash-up site is typically done by programmers. In this paper, we introduce Potluck, a tool that lets casual users—non-programmers—make mash-ups by themselves:•Potluck allows the user to merge fields from different data sources, so that they are treated identically for sorting, filtering, and visualization. Fields are merged using simple drag and drop of field names.•Potluck provides an efficient means for the user to clean up data syntactically, homogenize data formats, and extract fields syntactically embedded within existing fields, all through the application of simultaneous editing [9].•Potluck supports faceted browsing [19] to let users explore and identify subsets of data of interest or subsets of data that need alignment and clean up.In contrast, today’s mash-up construction can only be done by programmers using complex technologies as it involves many technical challenges, particularly:•scraping data from the original sites, where it may be hidden behind complex queries and web templates;•aligning the original sites’ data into a single coherent data model; and•creating an effective visualization of the merged data.These challenges are only worth to overcome for mash-ups that will appeal to many people, and they prevent the construction of mash-ups that are personal or narrow in appeal, serving only a few users and giving little return on investment of efforts and resources. For example, a high-school student writing a term report on the knowledge and use of mycology (mushrooms) among Polynesian tribes will be unlikely to find a mash-up site containing data on both mycology as well as Polynesians. She will also unlikely find enough resources (money and programming skills) to get such a site built quickly enough to meet her deadline, if ever built at all. The long tail of mash-up needs is thus left unanswered. As more and more data becomes readily accessible on the Semantic Web, the number of mash-ups potentially useful but never built increases significantly and spells a huge opportunity miss, reducing the value proposition of the Semantic Web itself.We conducted a user study of Potluck and report the results here, which show that Potluck is a viable mash up solution for casual users and that it even has features desired by programmers.2. ScenarioBefore describing the user interface of Potluck, we motivate it with a scenario that illustrates various idiosyncrasies of personal mash-up construction. Let us be optimistic that within a decade, the Semantic Web will be prevalent and RDF data will be everywhere. This scenario argues that even in this future world, users will still face problems making mash-ups between data sources.In 2017, a historian named Henry is documenting the first cases of a rare genetic disease called GD726. These first cases occurred in the Valentine family in the 1820s. He wants to include in his final report a genealogical tree of the Valentine family, annotated with the disease’s infliction, as well as a comprehensive table of the Valentines’ data in an appendix.Like most historians, Henry is not a programmer but he is experienced in collecting and managing data in his professional work. The proliferation of RDF means that Henry does not need programming skills to scrape HTML himself: all the information needed for his research has been converted into RDF by various independent organizations and individuals, both professionals and enthusiasts. Henry thinks it would be trivial to simply pool the RDF together and call it done.Henry tracks down various birth certificate issuing offices and death certificate issuing offices where the Valentines lived for their RDF data. He notes that some offices use dc:date in their data to mean “birth date,” some to mean “death date,” and some “certificate issuing date.” It would be disastrous to consider all the dc:dates the same even if the same predicate URI is used.Henry also tracks down hospital records, which contain hospital:tod (short for “time of death”). Hence, hospital:tod is equivalent to some of the dc:dates. It would be hard to match hospital:tod with dc:date based on string analysis alone, yet match for some of the cases only.The records all have geographical location names, but these names are not fully qualified. Those responsible for digitizing them thought that since all locations were within their country, there was no need to include the country name.As a consequence, Henry needs to append the country name to the many location names in order to map them.People’s names are encoded in two different forms: “first-name last-name” in some data sets and “last-name, first-name” in others. Nick names are also present (e.g., “Bill” instead of “William”, and “Vicky” instead of “Victoria”).The hospital records also pose problems. While most of their admittance dates are in ISO 8601 format, a few are of the kind “Easter Day 1824.” Such sloppiness has been observed in industrial and institutional databases, and should be expected on the Semantic Web.Despite all these problems, there is one good thing about the data: Henry can reliably get the mother and father of each Valentine through the gen:mother and gen:father predicates, which seem to be very widely adopted. This helps Henry construct a genealogical tree visualization.However, as males and females both have equal chance of passing on GD726, Henry wants to treat gen:mother and gen:father the same while tracing the disease through the family. Unfortunately, adding an owl:sameAs equivalence between those two predicates will break his genealogical tree.While all parties involved in this scenario acted logically and responsibly, Henry still ends up with a mess of RDF. To fix up the data, Henry must be able to:•Merge dc:dates into several groups (the birth dates and the death dates) even though they all use the same predicate URI. This requires distinguishing the fields by their origins rather than just by their URIs.•Merge gen:mother and gen:father together in some situations while keeping them separate in other situations. This precludes the simple approach of adding owl:sameAs statements in the data model to implement equivalences.•Edit the data efficiently to unify its syntax.•Fix up the data iteratively as he learns more and more about the data.There is one more challenge that Henry faces which we choose not to address at the moment: that of entity alignment. A person might be referred to by different URIs in different sources, and Henry must make them all equivalent to one another. We leave this task to future work, as we have not found any reasonable user interface solution to it.3. User interfaceWe now describe Potluck’s user interface, showing how it addresses the problems in the scenario above. The reader is encouraged to view a screencast to understand Potluck’s interactivity: http://simile.mit.edu/potluck/.Fig. 1 shows the starting screen of Potluck where the user can paste in several URLs of Exhibit-powered web pages and click Mix Data. This results in  Fig. 2, which lists data records from the original web pages. The records are interleaved by origins—the pages from which they have been extracted—to ensure that some records of each data set are always visible.prs.rt(\"abs_1st_end\");<img class=\"figure large\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Full-size image ( K)\" src=\"http://origin-ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S1570826808000693-gr1.jpg\" data-thumbEID=\"1-s2.0-S1570826808000693-gr1.sml\" data-imgEIDs=\"1-s2.0-S1570826808000693-gr1.jpg\" data-fullEID=\"1-s2.0-S1570826808000693-gr1.jpg\">Fig. 1. The starting screen of Potluck takes URLs to Exhibit-powered web pages.

There are two-drop target areas for creating columns and facets.Figure optionsDownload full-size imageDownload as PowerPoint slideFields are rendered as field tags:<img height=\"16\" border=\"0\" style=\"vertical-align:bottom\" width=\"146\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" src=\"http://origin-ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S1570826808000693-fx1.jpg\">. Field tags are color-coded to indicate their origins: blue from one source and pink from another in  Fig. 2. Three core fields, label, type, and origin, are automatically assigned to all records and their tags are colored gray. origin is generated from each source URL. label and type are reserved as they are core Exhibit fields and assumed to be used in a uniform manner across different exhibits.Fields from different origins having the same name are considered different. For example, while <img height=\"17\" border=\"0\" style=\"vertical-align:bottom\" width=\"42\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" src=\"http://origin-ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S1570826808000693-fx2a.jpg\"> means office phone, <img height=\"17\" border=\"0\" style=\"vertical-align:bottom\" width=\"40\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" src=\"http://origin-ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S1570826808000693-fx2b.jpg\"> might mean secretary’s phone. Or more dangerously, dc:date in the scenario (in Section 2) has several distinct meanings. These semantic differences, subtle or significant, might or might not be important to one particular user at one particular moment in time. Keeping the fields apart rather than automatically merging them together allows the user to make the decision whether or not to merge.3.1. Creating columns and facetsA field tag can be dragged and dropped onto the gray column to the left (Fig. 2) to create a new column listing that field, or onto the gray box to the right to create a facet for filtering by that field. Fig. 3 shows a newly created column. A column or facet can be moved by dragging its field tag and dropping the tag between other columns or facets. Deleting a column or facet (by clicking it <img height=\"15\" border=\"0\" style=\"vertical-align:bottom\" width=\"15\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" src=\"http://origin-ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S1570826808000693-fx3.jpg\">) removes the column or facet from the display but does not delete the corresponding field’s data.<img class=\"figure large\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Full-size image (96 K)\" src=\"http://origin-ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S1570826808000693-gr3.jpg\" data-thumbEID=\"1-s2.0-S1570826808000693-gr3.sml\" data-imgEIDs=\"1-s2.0-S1570826808000693-gr3.jpg\" data-fullEID=\"1-s2.0-S1570826808000693-gr3.jpg\">Fig. 3. Potluck renders a new column to the left when <img height=\"17\" border=\"0\" style=\"vertical-align:bottom\" width=\"40\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" src=\"http://origin-ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S1570826808000693-fx6.jpg\"> is dropped into the New Column drop target.

Merging fieldsA field tag can be dropped onto an existing column or facet in order to make that column or facet contain data for both the original field and the newly dropped field. Such an operation creates a merged field, whose field tag is rendered as a visual juxtaposition of the original tags, taking on a pill-shaped form <img height=\"17\" border=\"0\" style=\"vertical-align:bottom\" width=\"75\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" src=\"http://origin-ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S1570826808000693-fx4.jpg\">.

Thus, in the scenario, it would be easy to have gen:mother and gen:father merged together for one purpose while keeping them separate for another purpose, all at the same time. Furthermore, the merging operation is not transitive, so that, say, merging fields mother and father together (to mean parent) and then mother and grandmother together (to mean female ancestor) does not force all three fields to be merged into mother/father/grandmother.3.3. Simultaneous editingThe edit link next to each field value opens up the Simultaneous Editing dialog box where the values of that field can be edited en masse ( Fig. 5). The concept of simultaneous editing originated from LAPIS  [9], a text editor that displays several keyboard cursors simultaneously on a text document, generalizes the user’s editing actions at one cursor, and applies them to the text at the rest of the cursors. Based on the user’s mouse clicks, LAPIS guesses how to divide the text document into records (often into lines or paragraphs) and where the cursors should be placed within those records (e.g., after the second word of the third sentence in each paragraph). Whereas LAPIS has to guess what a record is for the purpose of simultaneous editing, Potluck already has the field values conveniently separate. Potluck groups field values into columns by structural similarity, e.g., the phone numbers in the second column all have area code 212. These columns serve to visually separate out values of different forms, call out outliers (such as “Easter Day 1824” in the scenario), and let the user edit different forms differently. The user can click on any field value to give it keyboard focus, and editing changes made to it are applied to other values in the same column in a similar fashion. The multiple cursors in  Fig. 5 give visual feedback of the simultaneous editing operations in progress.<img class=\"figure large\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Full-size image (41 K)\" src=\"http://origin-ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S1570826808000693-gr5.jpg\" data-thumbEID=\"1-s2.0-S1570826808000693-gr5.sml\" data-imgEIDs=\"1-s2.0-S1570826808000693-gr5.jpg\" data-fullEID=\"1-s2.0-S1570826808000693-gr5.jpg\">Fig. 5. Potluck’s Simultaneous Editing dialog box lets the user change several similar values simultaneously by editing any one of them. Multiple keyboard cursors are shown and any editing change to the focused value is immediately reflected in the other values.Figure optionsDownload full-size imageDownload as PowerPoint slideIf a value appears in several records it is shown in only one entry in the dialog box. In the scenario, if the nickname “Bill” appears in three records, the user can click on its single entry in the dialog box, set the checkbox Edit this value separately from the others, and change it to “William” to correct all three records.Simultaneous editing is useful for correcting inconsistencies between data sets that occur many times, such as prefixing area codes to phone numbers and wrapping existing area codes in parentheses. It is also useful for reformatting a field, such as changing “first-name last-name” into “last-name, first-name”, and for making a new field out of an existing field, such as extracting building numbers (32) from within office numbers (32–582).Faceted browsing[19] is a browsing paradigm in which a set of records can be filtered progressively along several dimensions in any arbitrary order. For example, a set of recipes can be filtered by picking an ingredient first, a cooking method second, and a cuisine finally, or by picking a cuisine first, then an ingredient, and a cooking method finally depending on which order suits the user best. Because the data Potluck handles is often multidimensional, faceted browsing is useful in Potluck as it is designed for exploring multidimensional data in flexible, user-controllable ways. Exploration is needed for identifying and selecting out just the subset of data that is useful as well as for isolating on records that need cleaning up. All faceted browsers so far assume that they are fed data sets that have already been cleaned and made coherent using other tools. In Potluck, we extended faceted browsing for the mash-up task in which data arrives from many sources.If within a facet there are records for which the corresponding field is missing, the facet explicitly shows a choice for filtering to those records (Fig. 6). This visual element, not present in conventional faceted browsing interfaces, also serves to remind the user that, if that field is an elemental field instead of a merged field, the field is not present for records in other data sets.<img class=\"figure large\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Full-size image (30 K)\" src=\"http://origin-ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S1570826808000693-gr6.jpg\" data-thumbEID=\"1-s2.0-S1570826808000693-gr6.sml\" data-imgEIDs=\"1-s2.0-S1570826808000693-gr6.jpg\" data-fullEID=\"1-s2.0-S1570826808000693-gr6.jpg\">Fig. 6. If inside a facet there are records for which the corresponding field is missing, the facet shows <img height=\"17\" border=\"0\" style=\"vertical-align:bottom\" width=\"89\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" src=\"http://origin-ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S1570826808000693-fx5.jpg\"> as a choice so that the user can get to those records.Figure optionsDownload full-size imageDownload as PowerPoint slideWhile working with multiple data sets at the same time, it can be easy to forget that an elemental field from one data set does not exist in the others. Whenever a facet choice causes all records from an origin to be filtered out completely, that origin remains in the origin facet and a message is popped up drawing the user’s attention to it (Fig. 7).<img class=\"figure large\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Full-size image (14 K)\" src=\"http://origin-ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S1570826808000693-gr7.jpg\" data-thumbEID=\"1-s2.0-S1570826808000693-gr7.sml\" data-imgEIDs=\"1-s2.0-S1570826808000693-gr7.jpg\" data-fullEID=\"1-s2.0-S1570826808000693-gr7.jpg\">Fig. 7. The origin facet does not remove choices for which there are no records. Moreover, it pops up messages to call the user’s attention to those filtered out origins.Figure optionsDownload full-size imageDownload as PowerPoint slide3.4. VisualizationsPotluck currently provides two visualizations: a tabular view and a map view. We have discussed the tabular view extensively while the map view can be seen in the screencast accompanying this paper. Any field containing street address or as latitude/longitude pair can be dropped onto the map view to plot the records without doing any programming.3.5. MiscellanyPotluck provides drop down menus on left clicks as alternatives to drag and drop in order to increase the likelihood that the user succeeds at finding some way to accomplish a task. The browser’s Back and Forward buttons can be used to redo and undo user actions. Like contemporary highly interactive web interfaces, Potluck also shows the most recently done or undone action and provides a link to undo or redo it.4. ImplementationPotluck consists of two components: a server-side component implemented as a Java servlet, responsible for retrieving the data within the Exhibit-embedding web pages to mix; and a client-side component implemented in Javascript on top of the Exhibit API [5], responsible for all the user interface interactivity.Merged fields are implemented as query unions: when the values of a merged field are requested, the values of each elemental field in that merged field are returned in a single result set. No equivalence is added into the data model so that merging operations will not be transitive and so that the original elemental fields can still be used in isolation even after they have been merged.Simultaneous editing is implemented in Javascript. Each field value is parsed into a sequence of features. Features are runs of digits, of letters, or of white spaces, or individual punctuation marks and symbols. For example, “733–3647” is broken down into three features: the run of digits “733”, the symbol “-”, and the run of digits “3647”. Field values are then clustered into columns by greedily aligning these sequences of features.As the user moves the keyboard cursor, makes selections, and edits the text of one value, the cursor positions are generalized to be relative to the features of the field value being edited (e.g., “second character from the beginning of the third last feature”), and then those generalized cursor positions are turned into absolute cursor positions of each of the other field values in the same cluster and used to apply the edit. Secondary cursors are rendered using colored <span> elements.As the clipboard Cut and Paste operations cannot be reliably detected in web browsers, we must support cut-and-paste in the simultaneous editing paradigm using a trick. When some text is inserted, we check if that same piece of text has previously been deleted in one edit action and assume that what has taken place is a cut-and-paste operation. Note that this trick works only for cut-and-paste, not copy-and-paste.5. EvaluationWe conducted a user study on Potluck in early 2007 to ascertain whether people could learn how to use Potluck as well as to discover usability problems. We also wanted to observe how people use Potluck in an open-ended task using their own judgment about which fields to merge and edit, and how to display them.5.1. Design and procedureThis study consists of two tasks: a structured task during which the subjects performed simple steps to familiarize themselves with Potluck, and an unstructured task during which the subjects performed an open ended task based on the skills they had just acquired.In Task #1, subjects browsed two web pages containing information about 92 people in a lab and 33 people in another lab, and answered questions about these people in ways that required the pages’ faceted browsing features (e.g., “how many people are in the Gates tower?”). This warm-up exercise let the subjects learn about the data and about faceted browsing. Then the subjects were asked to use Potluck to mix the data in those pages and to achieve the following goals:•create a column listing the buildings where people work and make sure the column is filled in with information for people from both labs;•create a column listing people’s phone numbers and edit them to have the form (xxx) xxx-xxxx, using 617 for phone numbers without area code;•create a column listing people’s job titles;•create a facet of people’s job titles, use it to filter for people in directing positions (directors and co-directors), and determine how many such people there are in each lab; and•create a column of people’s last names and sort it in ascending order.These instructions were not worded in low-level details (e.g., click this button) so to allow the subjects the opportunities to learn how to use Potluck’s user interface by themselves and to allow us the chance to discover usability problems.In Task #2, the subjects were asked to use Potluck to mix data from two Exhibit-powered web pages of 40 + 55 publications and then mock up a single web page where hypothetical visitors could conveniently sort and filter through all of those publications as if the data came from a single source. The subjects were left to their own discretion to decide which columns and facets to create, although some examples were given in case the subjects were not familiar with the domain.5.2. Participants and apparatusSix subjects (2 male, 4 female) from a university community were recruited by sending an e-mail message to a mailing list and posting paper ads around our college campus. Four were younger than 30, and two older than 30. They were two students (mechanical engineering and computer science), two researchers (applied math and brain and cognitive science), a lawyer, and an applied math consultant.We also recruited five subjects (1 male and 4 female) from our campus’ libraries, who worked with data in their daily job. Two were in their 20 s, one 30 s, and two 40 s. We wanted to observe if librarians, who have more experience working with data, would use Potluck differently.There were a total of 11 subjects, referred to as G1 to G6 from the general university population and L1 to L5 from the libraries. All browsed the Web at least a few times a day and used Firefox as one of their primary browsers.Subjects received $10 each for participating in a 30–45 min study session. All sessions were conducted by one investigator on a single computer (Pentium 4 2.53 GHz, 1.00 GB) with an 18 “LCD flat panel at 1600 × 1200 resolution in 32-bit color and a Dell two-button mouse with wheel, running Microsoft Windows XP. The study facilitator observed the subjects and took written notes.5.3. ResultsAll subjects were able to learn Potluck’s user interface with little guidance and to complete the user study’s tasks within 45 min. We now report the results in more details and point out usability issues to address in the future.5.3.1. ColumnsNine subjects out of 11 used only drag and drop to create columns. This indicates that the relevant visual cues for drag and drop may be sufficiently strong, as there was no explicit instruction to drag and drop. One of the other two subjects, G5, used the Create Column menu command at first but adopted drag and drop later. L1 used only the menu command.G5 and L5 had difficulty understanding that dragging a field tag to create a column automatically filled up the whole column with data wherever the field was available. They continued to drag the same field tag out again and again for each row, paying no attention to the data already shown in the column. We can improve the drag feedback to better indicate that the whole field is being dragged, such as showing ghosted images of several field values near the mouse pointer.All except one subject merged columns using drag and drop; G2 used the corresponding menu command. G3 and G4 expected the phone fields from both sources in Task #1 to be merged automatically. We can make Potluck suggest such merging if the field names match precisely.Most subjects merged position and title together into one column, but one subject also included group to more fully qualify position. This was because most title values were more specific than most position values (e.g., “Codi-rector of Marketing” vs. “professor”). This operation was actually not what the subject intended (as he verbalized): the operation performed a set union of two fields instead of a string concatenation. But as Potluck rendered the group value after the position value for each record (e.g., “professor, computer architecture”), the visual outcome looked right and the subject was contented. However, sorting on this merged field would produce random orders and a facet created out of this merged field would list the group and position values separately, not paired together. Potluck should support string concatenation and suggest it as an alternative to merging whenever the two fields involved come from the same source. Note that in the scenario in Section 2, concatenation is probably not the desired choice when the gen:mother field is dropped onto the gen:father field even though both come from the same source.5.3.2. FacetsAll subjects used drag and drop to create facets. Two subjects initially created facets using the corresponding menu command, but they discovered the drag and drop alternative and did not revert to the menu. Merging facets was done solely using drag and drop. We note that the field tags on facets do not offer any menu (an oversight in our implementation); only field tags in the details column and in the column headers support menus.Some subjects tended to drag already merged field tags from columns to create facets while the others dragged elemental field tags from the Details column to create merged facets. The latter behavior forced the user to re-merge fields she has already merged; this is both inefficient and error-prone as some subjects did forget to re-merge fields. Potluck should have automatically suggested or defaulted to the merged field whenever an elemental field that has been merged is used.G4 did not initially merge facets in Task #1 to filter for people in directing positions. Instead, he created two facets, position and title, from the two sources separately and used <img height=\"17\" border=\"0\" style=\"vertical-align:bottom\" width=\"89\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" src=\"http://origin-ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S1570826808000693-fx5.jpg\"> to achieve the goal. In either facet, he selected directing positions as well as <img height=\"17\" border=\"0\" style=\"vertical-align:bottom\" width=\"89\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" src=\"http://origin-ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S1570826808000693-fx5.jpg\"> so that records in the other source were not excluded. This required on his part deeper understanding of how faceted browsing worked. When asked to achieve the goal without using <img height=\"17\" border=\"0\" style=\"vertical-align:bottom\" width=\"89\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" src=\"http://origin-ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S1570826808000693-fx5.jpg\">, field, he discovered that he could merge facets.5.3.3. Simultaneous editingAll subjects were able to edit several phone numbers using the simultaneous editing feature. G1 anticipated this feature even before clicking edit, asking out loud, “can I edit them all together?” She later used the feature to delete first names from people’s full names to get a field of last names. This action properly utilized the simultaneous editing feature’s power but destroyed data (the first names). We can make Potluck alert the user of this loss and offer a convenient way to apply the edit on a copy of the original field instead.G4 tried to move the leading “A” from publication titles to the end (e.g., “Tale of Two Cities, A”) using simultaneous editing (a reasonable goal) but the facilitator explained that the feature did not support that case. L2 and G6 tried to swap first names and last names so that publications could be sorted by their authors’ last names. L2 selected a last name in the simultaneous editing dialog box and dragged it to the front of the corresponding first name; unfortunately, a bug prevented this from working. G6 used keyboard shortcuts for cut-and-paste and succeeded. These subjects’ actions indicated some intuitiveness in using cut-and-paste and drag-and-drop for simultaneous editing.G3 expressed that she did not want to see all phone numbers in the simultaneous editing dialog box but only their templates. G5 and L3 edited only the first group of phone numbers, and L4 edited only the first and third groups, neglecting the groups that were not scrolled into view. To avoid such oversight, we will need to make it more apparent which pieces of data an edit does and does not affect.5.3.4. Librarians vs. general subjectsAmong the five librarians, four were catalogers (who characterize physical artifacts such as books and enter their metadata into databases), and one was a programmer responsible for integrating large data sets. While the catalogers showed no significant difference with the general subjects in their use of Potluck, the programmer, L1, was clearly an outlier: he created 10 columns and 7 facets in total. He was very excited about the user interface of Potluck and described his data integration work, consisting of manual data entry and Perl scripting, to be tedious and painful.G6, who also needed programming skills to deal with some data for his work, expressed equal enthusiasm for Potluck. He used simultaneous editing to swap first name and last name. Thus, while there was no noticeable difference between the subjects from the general population and the librarians, who purportedly work with data and metadata on a daily basis, there was a difference between programmers and non-programmers in how much they appreciated Potluck. Programmers, who have encountered difficulties in dealing with data even with their programming skills, appreciated Potluck more. Non-programmers accomplished the tasks in the study equally well, but were not equally excited perhaps because there was not enough reusable data on the Web for them to feel the need to mash up data themselves. However, when there will be more reusable data in the future, interfaces like that of Potluck have the potential to level the playing field for non-programmers, making them as effective as programmers for the task of mashing up data.6. Related workPiggy Bank [6] and Tabulator [3] illustrate how personal mash-up tools with generic functionality can let individual Web users satisfy their own unique combinations of mash-up needs. While Tabulator consumes only RDF data, Piggy Bank can also run screen scrapers to extract data from HTML pages—a design to overcome the current shortage of RDF data on the Web. While the proliferation of structured data on the Web will hopefully eliminate the need to scrape fragile HTML, the data still has to be cleaned up and aligned before it can appear coherent to the user and thus become useful. The amount of broken HTML code at the present forebodes messy real-world RDF in the future, broken perhaps not just in syntax but also in semantics. Personal mash-up tools like Piggy Bank and Tabulator have largely ignored this problem, assuming that once data is in RDF, conventional visualizations and browsing techniques previously designed to work on individual coherent data sets can be applied readily on mashed up data.An exception to these tools is WebScripter [18], which lets casual users create coherent reports out of data collected from several sources, offering data alignment features for that purpose. Although the desired target audience is casual users, WebScripter’s interface is still expert-oriented, full of jargon such as “DAML”, “class”, “instance”, etc. WebScripter offers no feature for fixing data at the syntactic level (e.g., swapping first name and last name) and it has not been formally evaluated on actual users.There are also web applications such as Dapper [1] that let users scrape existing web sites for data and serve that data up in structured formats as “feeds,” or make use of data already scraped by other people. These web applications still offer very limited capabilities for cleaning up data, integrating data in different schemas, and constructing rich visualizations. Those that offer more capabilities, such as Ning [2], require programming.In research, data alignment tools have been built mostly for experts and research has focused primarily on data modeling theories and automated agents for ontology alignment [7], [8], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14] and [16] rather than on user interfaces for making practical use of aggregated data. Because they specialize only in data alignment, they implicitly assume that users work with the data in delineated stages, first aligning the data and cleaning it up, and then making use of that data in some other tools. We believe that users actually work iteratively on data, switching from aligning and clean up the data to using the data, and back, as they get to know the data better over time. Furthermore, these tools tend to work on ontological abstractions, basing their interface interactions on concepts such as classes. Casual users have little knowledge about data modeling and ontological abstractions, and little interest in learning.Faceted browsing was pioneered by Yee et al. [19] and recently adopted by the Semantic Web research community [4], [15] and [17]. We extended faceted browsing to allow selection of records that are missing data. Simultaneous editing has been researched previously [9] and we extended it with the automatic clustering of field values into columns.7. ConclusionIn this paper, we presented Potluck, a tool for casual users—those without programming skills and data modeling expertise—to mash up data by themselves. Potluck is novel in its use of drag and drop for merging fields, its integration and extension of the faceted browsing paradigm for focusing on subsets of data to align, and its application of the simultaneous editing technique for cleaning up data syntactically. Potluck also lets the user construct rich visualizations of data in-place as the user aligns and cleans up the data. This iterative process of integrating the data while constructing useful visualizations is desirable when the user is unfamiliar with the data at the beginning—a common case—and wishes to get immediate value out of the data without having to spend the overhead of completely and perfectly integrating the data first. A user study on Potluck indicated that it was usable and learnable, and solicited excitement from programmers who, even with their programming skills, had great difficulties in integrating data.AcknowledgementsWe are grateful to the user study subjects for their time and their feedback.

Adding in another $330 for a motherboard, $180 for 12GB of DDR3-1866 memory, $1400 for two W7000 GPUs and $220 for a fast SATA SSD (Samsung 840 Pro) we’re at $2730 for a configuration that would cost at least $3499 from Apple. That’s excluding case, PSU and OS, but adding another ~$350 takes care of that and still saves you some money. If you opt for Radeon HD 7870s instead of the W7000 you can knock another $1000 off of that total price. All of that being said, I don’t expect there to be a lot of cross shopping between DIY builders and those looking for a Mac Pro.","mm_name":"rich_document","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Setting Expectations: A Preview of What's to Come in Mobile","description":"The bigger takeaway from this is the following: the very same limited gains in CPU performance will eventually come to ultra mobile devices as well. It’s only a matter of time before those CPU curves flatten out. What that does to the smartphone/tablet market is a discussion for another day.","mm_name":"rich_document","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Plotting the Mac Pro’s GPU Performance Over Time","description":"The similarities between what I’m saying here about GPU performance and AMD’s mantra over the past few years aren’t lost. The key difference between Apple’s approach and those of every other GPU company is that Apple spends handsomely to ensure it has close to the best single threaded CPU performance as well as the best GPU performance. This is an important distinction, and ultimately the right approach.","mm_name":"rich_document","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"CPU Choices","description":"If you want the best balance of heavily threaded performance without sacrificing performance in lighter workloads, the 8-core configuration seems to be the best bet. There are definitely bragging rights associated with the 12-core system, but unless you absolutely need a ton of cores you’re likely better suited by the 8-core configuration.","mm_name":"rich_document","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"CPU Performance","description":"There isn't much of an advantage to having 12 cores here, but the new Mac Pro does deliver an amazingly quick build time compared to anything else. The new Mac Pro is good for around a 24% improvement in build performance compared to the outgoing 12-core model.","mm_name":"rich_document","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Putting Mac Pro Performance in Perspective: Professional Apps","description":"It is really surprising just how big of an impact GPU performance can have on Final Cut Pro 10.1. It makes total sense that Apple went dual GPUs top to bottom with the new Mac Pro. It seems the latest version of Final Cut Pro was designed with the new Mac Pro in mind, which is unfortunate for anyone who was hoping to get by with an older Mac Pro with a far less capable GPU. It's very clear to me that the Mac Pro is really designed to be an upgrade on all fronts (CPU, GPU, SSD and external IO). The question is how many of those parts have existing Mac Pro users upgraded on their own. The answer to that will ultimately determine how big of a step forward the new Mac Pro really is.","mm_name":"rich_document","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Mac Pro vs. Consumer Macs","description":"Our Lightroom 3 export test tells a very similar story. Anyone with lighter workloads looking for a huge performance increase thanks to the Mac Pro will have to look elsewhere. The Mac Pro is at least performance competitive, but in these lightly threaded workloads you won't see a huge uplift.","mm_name":"rich_document","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"The PCIe Layout","description":"The part I haven’t quite figured out yet is how Apple handles DisplayPort functionality. All six Thunderbolt 2 ports are capable of outputting to a display, which means that there’s either a path from the FirePro to each Thunderbolt 2 controller or the PEX 8723 switch also handles DisplayPort switching. It doesn’t really matter from an end user perspective as you can plug a monitor into any port and have it work, it’s more of me wanting to know how it all works.","mm_name":"rich_document","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"GPU Choices","description":"Final Cut Pro’s division of labor between CPU and GPUs exemplifies what you’ll need to see happen across the board if you want big performance gains going forward. If you’re not bound by storage performance and want more than double digit increases in performance, your applications will have to take advantage of GPU computing to get significant speedups. There are some exceptions (e.g. leveraging AVX hardware in the CPU cores), but for the most part this heterogeneous approach is what needs to happen. What we’ve seen from FCP shows us that the solution won’t come in the form of CPU performance no longer mattering and GPU performance being all we care about. A huge portion of my workflow in Final Cut Pro is still CPU bound, the GPU is used to accelerate certain components within the application. You need the best of both to build good, high performance systems going forward.","mm_name":"rich_document","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Gaming Performance","description":"Metro is the one outlier in our test suite. Although CrossFire is clearly working under Windows, under Metro the D700 behaves as if it wasn't. I'm not sure what's going on here, but this does serve as a reminder that relying on multi-GPU setups to increase performance does come with a handful of these weird cases - particularly if you're using non-standard GPU configurations.","mm_name":"rich_document","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"4K Support","description":"","mm_name":"rich_document","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"The 4K Experience","description":"The rest of the 4K experience under OS X was pretty good. The PN-K321 display seemed far more compatible with the Mac Pro setup than the UP2414Q. Wake from sleep wasn't an issue the vast majority of the time. I did have one situation where I had to disconnect/reconnect the DisplayPort cable after the display wouldn't wake up.","mm_name":"rich_document","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"SSD","description":"I’m beyond pleased to see that Apple has moved its Mac lineup virtually top to bottom to PCIe SSDs. This is absolutely the right approach, and one that all other OEMs should follow.","mm_name":"rich_document","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Gigabit Ethernet & WiFi","description":"","mm_name":"rich_document","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Thunderbolt 2","description":"","mm_name":"rich_document","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Power Consumption & Noise","description":"You don't even need a power virus to get there. Running two realistic workloads that are heavy enough won't get you up to the 463W point where I saw throttling, but it'll get you close to the max average power I recorded on the Mac Pro.","mm_name":"rich_document","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"}],"specifications":[{"title":"Mac Pro (Late 2013) Default Configurations","mm_name":"rich_document","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"","description":"4-Core Config","mm_name":"rich_document","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"CPU","description":"Intel Xeon E5-1620 v2","mm_name":"rich_document","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Base CPU Clock","description":"3.7GHz","mm_name":"rich_document","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Max Turbo","description":"3.9GHz","mm_name":"rich_document","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Cores / Threads","description":"4 / 8","mm_name":"rich_document","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"L3 Cache","description":"10MB","mm_name":"rich_document","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Memory","description":"12GB ECC DDR3-1866 (3 x 4GB)","mm_name":"rich_document","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"SSD","description":"256GB PCIe SSD","mm_name":"rich_document","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"GPU","description":"Dual AMD FirePro D300","mm_name":"rich_document","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"GPU Memory","description":"2GB GDDR5 per card","mm_name":"rich_document","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Network","description":"Dual Gigabit LAN + 3-stream 802.11ac","mm_name":"rich_document","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Thunderbolt 2","description":"6 x Thunderbolt 2 Ports","mm_name":"rich_document","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Display Support","description":"2 x 4K/60Hz + 1 x 4K/30Hz or up to 6 x 2560 x 1440 Thunderbolt/DisplayPort Displays","mm_name":"rich_document","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"USB 3.0","description":"4 x USB 3.0 Ports","mm_name":"rich_document","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Other IO","description":"Optical digital/analog audio out","mm_name":"rich_document","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Dimensions","description":"6.6 x 6.6 x 9.9\" (L x W x H)","mm_name":"rich_document","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Weight","description":"11 lbs","mm_name":"rich_document","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Warranty","description":"1 Year Limited","mm_name":"rich_document","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Price","description":"$2999","mm_name":"rich_document","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"}],"main_images":[{"location":"http://images.anandtech.com/doci/7603/DSC_4676sm_678x452.jpg","mm_name":"image","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"}],"favicon":{"location":"http://www.anandtech.com/favicon.ico","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","mm_name":"image"},"download_status":"DOWNLOAD_DONE","mm_name":"anandtech_review"}}

With the present firepit, a controlled fire may be safely displayed in almost any outdoor space, including residential areas of urban and suburban locales.","site_name":"Google Books","filing_date":"Sep 30, 1997","mm_name":"google_patent","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"}}],"drawings":[{"location":"http://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/thumbnails/pages/US5868128-1.png","mm_name":"image","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"location":"http://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/thumbnails/pages/US5868128-2.png","mm_name":"image","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"location":"http://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/thumbnails/pages/US5868128-3.png","mm_name":"image","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"location":"http://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/thumbnails/pages/US5868128-4.png","mm_name":"image","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"}],"main_images":[{"location":"http://www.google.com/patents?id=&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1","mm_name":"image","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"}],"download_status":"DOWNLOAD_DONE","mm_name":"google_patent"}}

{"getty_artist":{"title":"Vincennes Porcelain Manufactory","description":"The Vincennes Manufactory opened in 1740 in converted premises at the royal château of Vincennes. The factory was run by a former carpenter who had discovered the secret of producing brilliant white soft-paste porcelain. Five years later, the company was granted a royal warrant, giving it the exclusive right to produce \"porcelain in the style of Saxony, painted and gilded and depicting human figures\" and also to produce porcelain sculptures and flowers. Vincennes frequently copied the products of the extremely successful Meissen porcelain manufactory, the first in Europe to produce true hard-paste porcelain like that imported from China and Japan.    At the beginning, the factory produced numerous porcelain flowers, faithfully copied from nature.  Marchands-merciers  mounted the flowers on bronze stalks to create bouquets, placed them in vases, and used them to decorate a variety of other objects such as wall lights or chandeliers. Vincennes artists continued to look to Meissen products for inspiration, copying their stylized flowers or landscapes.    A new period began in 1748, when the goldsmith Jean-Claude Duplessis was hired. He introduced a new range of forms, including figures inspired by the work of François Boucher. The appointment of Jean-Jacques Bachelier as artistic director in 1752 brought changes to the decoration. In 1756, the factory was transferred to buildings specially built at Sèvres, where porcelain production continued.","location":"http://www.getty.edu/art/gettyguide/artMakerDetails?maker=1229","works":[{"title":"Lidded Bowl & Dish","location":"http://www.getty.edu/art/gettyguide/artObjectDetails?artobj=6864","mm_name":"getty_object","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Vase","location":"http://www.getty.edu/art/gettyguide/artObjectDetails?artobj=6242","mm_name":"getty_object","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Watering Can","location":"http://www.getty.edu/art/gettyguide/artObjectDetails?artobj=6706","mm_name":"getty_object","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Potpourri Vases","location":"http://www.getty.edu/art/gettyguide/artObjectDetails?artobj=6676","mm_name":"getty_object","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"}],"artist_info":{"lifespan":"active: about 1740 - 1756","professions":"","languages":"French"},"download_status":"DOWNLOAD_DONE","mm_name":"getty_artist"}}

{"getty_artist":{"title":"Louis-Léopold Boilly","description":"The son of a wood-sculptor, Louis-Léopold Boilly came from a modest background. As a teenager, he studied painting in the provinces, moving to Paris in 1785 only after ascertaining the marketability of his genre scenes. He established himself as a painter of slightly naughty images, which were especially popular with patrons who enjoyed the mischievous side of life. In 1794, an erotic painting elicited accusations of obscenity--an offense that carried the threat of prison and harsh penalties. A keen observer of human behavior, Boilly turned his attention to more public scenes, depicting the social customs of Parisians at the Salon, on the promenade, at the billiard table. He meticulously recorded facial details and gestures, and his depictions of costumes and textiles are fascinating as a chronicle of fashion. Boilly's paintings and drawings, often tinged with humor, showcase the artist's witty interpretation of urban life.","location":"http://www.getty.edu/art/gettyguide/artMakerDetails?maker=3318","works":[{"title":"Jardin Turc","location":"http://www.getty.edu/art/gettyguide/artObjectDetails?artobj=328733","mm_name":"getty_object","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Jardin Turc","location":"http://www.getty.edu/art/gettyguide/artObjectDetails?artobj=192074","mm_name":"getty_object","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Three Young Artists","location":"http://www.getty.edu/art/gettyguide/artObjectDetails?artobj=138860","mm_name":"getty_object","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"}],"artist_info":{"lifespan":"b.  1761 La Bassée, d.   1845 Paris","professions":"draftsman; painter","languages":"French"},"download_status":"DOWNLOAD_DONE","mm_name":"getty_artist"}}

{"rhizome_artist":{"title":"ui uuii","bio":"The most exotic of the Post-Impressionists, Ui Uuii was born in Paris in 1762. The son of a French journalist and a Peruvian woman, Ui Uuii spent his early childhood in Peru, attended a boarding school in France, and was a merchant seaman before becoming a stockbroker's assistant in 1871. At first merely an occasional painter represents the voice of a vast, ordinary world. Everyone seems to easily identify with his characters and the situations they find themselves in. He gives the twist of the ridiculous to everyday faults, foibles and successes and makes them a recognizable slice of life. Ui Uuii points out the humor in our lives, and in doing so, he touches our hearts. Because of this, his appeal is not restricted to any specific group. His qualities have endeared him to people from all walks of life. It is the fusion of these qualities that has resulted in television's biggest and most influential hit of the modern era. The show was credited by many for single-handedly resurrecting the sitcom genre. Ui Uuii's return to television after eight years was prompted by what he perceived as a lack of relevance and an abundance of superficiality in TV comedy programming. Ui Uuii frequented the Nouvelle Athenes Café where he met Pissarro and the Impressionists, whose works he purchased. He had married in 1873, and so it was not until ten years later that Ui Uuii decided to give up the business world and devote himself to the artistic. After a period in Rouen where he stayed with Pissarro, who had encouraged him, Ui Uuii met and had long discussions with Allan Kaprow, and he also met Claes Oldenburg, Jim Dine, Lucas Samaras and George Segal. He attended a number of early 'Happenings', but did not participate. After a lackluster apprenticeship, Ui Uuii went to Rome. By 1592, he was causing scandal, not only because of his volatile character and temper but because of his controversial painting methods. He rejected the lengthy preparations traditional in central Italy, preferring instead to work in oils directly from the subject - half-length figures and still life - as practiced by the Venetians. He aimed to make paintings that depicted the truth and he was critically condemned for being a naturalist. In spite of adverse reactions, Ui Uuii was commissioned to produce a number of large-scale paintings. However, certain of these after 1600 were made only to be rejected by patrons on the grounds of indecorum or theological incorrectness. His innovatory work nevertheless gained strong support and was a welcome antidote to Mannerism, or the limp compromises wrought by lesser artists working on religious themes. Supper at Emmaus is an example of Ui Uuii's virtuoso talent. Not only are the protagonists and the still life rendered equally with impeccable technique but the attitude of the apostles as they react to Christ is a remarkable interpretation. The circumstances and heightened emotion of the narrative are given further expression with dramatic chiaroscuro and powerful foreshortening. them actively. These contacts revived his interest in Pop imagery, and a more immediate stimulus was provided by a challenge from one of his sons, who pointed to a Mickey Mouse comic book and said; 'I bet you can't paint as good as that.' In 1961 Ui Uuii produced about six paintings showing characters from comic-strip frames, with only minor changes of color and form from the original source material. It was at this time that he first made use of devices which were to become signatures in his work - Ben-Day dots, lettering and speech balloons. Ui Uuii was then past thirty-five and almost penniless, though a loan from Degas, who approved of his theories on the importance of line, permitted him to go to Pont-Aven where he and Emile Bernard would develop Synthetism.","location":"http://rhizome.org/profile/uiuuii/","description":"Rhizome is dedicated to the creation, presentation, preservation, and critique of emerging artistic practices that engage technology.","creative_works":[{"title":"=-ap-prox::val::atr=-","location":"http://rhizome.org/artbase/artwork/48053/","description":"Rhizome is dedicated to the creation, presentation, preservation, and critique of emerging artistic practices that engage technology.","mm_name":"artwork","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"g:e:or::gi:a:n","location":"http://rhizome.org/artbase/artwork/48054/","description":"Rhizome is dedicated to the creation, presentation, preservation, and critique of emerging artistic practices that engage technology.","mm_name":"artwork","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"las2enancht:t:2","location":"http://rhizome.org/artbase/artwork/48195/","description":"Rhizome is dedicated to the creation, presentation, preservation, and critique of emerging artistic practices that engage technology.","mm_name":"artwork","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Tw[i.Ns::RiUinEs:swind:RIveRrES:","location":"http://rhizome.org/artbase/artwork/48075/","description":"Rhizome is dedicated to the creation, presentation, preservation, and critique of emerging artistic practices that engage technology.","mm_name":"artwork","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"}],"see_also":{"title":"Rhizome | \n\n\nui uuii","description":"Rhizome is dedicated to the creation, presentation, preservation, and critique of emerging artistic practices that engage technology.","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","mm_name":"rich_document"},"contact":{"title":"Rhizome | \n\n\nui uuii","description":"Rhizome is dedicated to the creation, presentation, preservation, and critique of emerging artistic practices that engage technology.","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","mm_name":"contact_point"},"spouse":{"title":"Rhizome | \n\n\nui uuii","description":"Rhizome is dedicated to the creation, presentation, preservation, and critique of emerging artistic practices that engage technology.","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","mm_name":"person"},"twitter_profile":{"title":"Rhizome | \n\n\nui uuii","description":"Rhizome is dedicated to the creation, presentation, preservation, and critique of emerging artistic practices that engage technology.","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","mm_name":"rich_document"},"favicon":{"location":"http://rhizome.org/static/images/favicons/leyva.gif","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","mm_name":"image"},"download_status":"DOWNLOAD_DONE","mm_name":"rhizome_artist"}}

Unfortunately, if you want to give it a shot, you'll need to live in Puerto Rico — the pilot will roll out in that territory in partnership with carriers OpenMobile and Claro. When Project Ara hits Puerto Rico, users should be able to customize their devices using the Ara Marketplace and Ara Configurator apps. Google's ATAP group will also roll out some \"food-truck\" style stores for consumers to actually check these devices out before they try them out.

Both features have been available in the Android app to some extent. For example, Google Translate for Android has long offered real-time translation of conversations. But Google's goal behind the latest version of the app is to enhance and simplify the features so they work more quickly and fluidly without any lag time. The latest version of Google Translate aims to change that. To converse with someone speaking in a different language, a user chooses his language and that of the other speaker. He then taps the microphone icon in the app, starts speaking in his native or selected language, and then taps the mic icon again. The app will recognize which of the two languages is being spoken, and then the two speakers can carry on their conversation without having to keep tapping the mic. In a test of the app's instant translation, The New York Times said it did prove to be a step forward; though, it's not science fiction just yet. The app fared best with short sentences that didn't include jargon, and it worked better when the users paused between each translation. Google also has beefed up the app's ability to translate street signs. Previously, you'd have to take a photo of the foreign text to get a translation of it. Now, you simply point your camera at the sign and the translated text appears overlaid on your screen — even if you're not connected to the Internet. This feature is made possible courtesy of Quest Visual's Word Lens app for iOS and Android, which Google acquired when it purchased the company last May. This feature supports English translated to and from French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Russian and Spanish. Google says it's working to add more languages.\"","mm_name":"SR","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"}},{"SR":{"author":"Soulskill","title":"Man Saves Wife's Sight By 3D Printing Her Tumor\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t154","location":"http://build.slashdot.org/story/15/01/14/1514247/man-saves-wifes-sight-by-3d-printing-her-tumor","description":"Michael Balzer, a former software engineer and Air Force technical instructor, found himself unsatisfied with a doctor's diagnosis of a small tumor behind his wife's left eye. Balzer had recently become proficient at creating 3D models, so he asked the doctor for the raw medical imaging data and took a look himself. In addition to correcting a later misdiagnosis, Balzer 3D printed models of his wife's cranium and helped neurosurgeons plan a procedure to remove the tumor, instead of waiting to see how it developed, like previous doctors had recommended. During the procedure, surgeons found the tumor was beginning to entangle her optic nerve, and even a six-month wait would have had dire consequences for her eyesight.  Medical researchers like Dr. Michael Patton believe this sort of prototyping will become \"the new normal\" in a very short time. He says, \"What you can now do through 3D printing is like what you're able to do in the software world: Rapid iteration, fail fast, get something to market quickly. You can print the prototypes, and then you can print out model organs on which to test the products. You can potentially obviate the need for some animal studies, and you can do this proof of concept before extensive patient trials are conducted.","mm_name":"SR","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"}},{"SR":{"author":"Soulskill","title":"Firefox 35 Arrives With MP4 Playback On Mac, Android Download Manager Support\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t175","location":"http://news.slashdot.org/story/15/01/13/217250/firefox-35-arrives-with-mp4-playback-on-mac-android-download-manager-support","description":"Mozilla today launched Firefox 35 for Windows, Mac, Linux, and Android.

One of the standard methods for assessing personality is to analyze people's answers to a 100-item questionnaire with a statistical technique called factor analysis. There are five main factors that divide people by personality—openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism—which is why personality researchers call this test the Big Five. People can accurately predict how their friends will answer the Big Five questions. ... Compared with humans predicting their friends' personalities by filling out the Big Five questionnaire, the computer's prediction based on Facebook likes was almost 15% more accurate on average, the team reports online today in PNAS (abstract).

Gathered in a stuffy conference room in the bowels of a hotel in Berlin, scores of respected climate researchers were arguing about a one-page document that had tentatively been christened the \"Berlin Declaration.\" It proposed ground rules for conducting experiments to explore how we might artificially cool the Earth—planet hacking, basically. This is the story of scientists' first major international meeting to tackle geoengineering.  It’s most commonly called geoengineering. Think Bond-villain-caliber schemes but with better intentions. It’s a highly controversial field that studies ideas like launching high-flying jets to dust the skies with sulfur in order to block out a small fraction of the solar rays entering the atmosphere, or sending a fleet of drones across the ocean to spray seawater into clouds to make them brighter and thus reflect more sunlight. Those are two of the most discussed proposals for using technology to chill the planet and combat climate change, and each would ostensibly cost a few billion dollars a year—peanuts in the scheme of the global economy. We’re about to see the dawn of the first real-world experiments designed to test ideas like these, but first, the scientists wanted to agree on a code of ethics—how to move forward without alarming the public or breaking any laws.","mm_name":"SR","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"}},{"SR":{"author":"timothy","title":"Four Facepalm Bugs In USPS Label-Printing Site\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t181","location":"http://tech.slashdot.org/story/15/01/07/2227216/four-facepalm-bugs-in-usps-label-printing-site","mm_name":"SR","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"}},{"SR":{"author":"Soulskill","title":"Ask Slashdot: High-Performance Laptop That Doesn't Overheat?\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t324","location":"http://ask.slashdot.org/story/15/01/08/1651209/ask-slashdot-high-performance-laptop-that-doesnt-overheat","description":"Last year we started to replace business/multimedia-grade laptops with gaming laptops at work, after several years of frustration with overheating and throttling issues that plagued our laptops from Acer, ASUS, Dell, Lenovo, and basically every brand you can find on market, making it impossible to write code and run db/test environment all on the same laptop. The first new batch comes from Clevo because their gaming laptops don't look like gaming laptops, and they offer 3-6 disk slots which we badly need. The result is acceptable, however, not quite as good as I had expected. Mine has i7-4700mq CPU which is more or less equivalent to an older i7 on the desktop, but its temperature is raised to 70-80C while turbo boost is on, even with the best thermal paste. My friend's i7-4801mq is worse — it could never stay at the advertised 3.6GHz for more than a few seconds before it burns up over 90 and starts to throttle.  Its benchmark result is nearly identical to the 4700mq because of heat problems. And it's only 3.6GHz! The best i7 CPU on a desktop could easily run closer to 5GHz with 6 cores / 12 threads running! So what should we choose next time? We're not looking for something cool or slim or light. We need real laptops which can at least run prime calculation at advertised turbo boost speed, full cores/threads for an entire day.

SpaceX has attempted similar maneuvers on three earlier Falcon 9 flights, and on the second and third attempts, the rocket slowed to a hover before splashing into the water. \"We've been able to soft-land the rocket booster in the ocean twice so far,\" says Musk. \"Unfortunately, it sort of sat there for several seconds, then tipped over and exploded. It's quite difficult to reuse at that point.\" \n\nAfter the booster falls away and the second stage continues pushing the payload to orbit, its engines will reignite to turn it around and guide it to a spot about 200 miles east of Jacksonville, Florida. Musk puts the chances of success at 50 percent or less but over the dozen or so flights scheduled for this year, \"I think it's quite likely, 80 to 90 percent likely, that one of those flights will be able to land and refly.\" SpaceX will offer its own launch webcast on the company's website beginning at 6 a.m. If SpaceX's gamble succeeds, the company plans to reuse the rocket stage on a later flight. \"Reusability is the critical breakthrough needed in rocketry to take things to the next level.\"","mm_name":"SR","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"}},{"SR":{"author":"samzenpus","title":"Better Learning Through Expensive Software?

But technology in the classroom is not going away, as one commenter notes. So, what to do? Well, since U.S. CTO Megan Smith is looking for bigger technological fish to fry than weaning the White House off floppy disks, why not give her a crack at Ed-Tech, including a healthy budget and some Lab Schools where she could have educators and technologists brainstorm-and-prototype to separate the Ed-Tech wheat from the chaff without undue vendor influence and short-term test score pressure?","mm_name":"SR","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"}},{"SR":{"author":"Soulskill","title":"Study: Police Body-Cams Reduce Unacceptable Use of Force\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t368","location":"http://tech.slashdot.org/story/14/12/24/1358225/study-police-body-cams-reduce-unacceptable-use-of-force","description":"Incidents like the Michael Brown case have recently put police body-worn cameras into the public consciousness, but they're not a new idea to criminology experts. In fact, researchers at Cambridge began a study in 2012 using law enforcement in Rialto, California as a test bed. Their results are now in: \"The experiment showed that evidence capture is just one output of body-worn video, and the technology is perhaps most effective at actually preventing escalation during police-public interactions: whether that's abusive behavior towards police or unnecessary use-of-force by police.\" The simple knowledge that both parties are being watched puts a damper on violence. \"During the 12-month Rialto experiment, use-of-force by officers wearing cameras fell by 59% and reports against officers dropped by 87% against the previous year's figures.\" This was enough for the city of Rialto to decide it wants to move forward with body-worn cameras; hopefully the study will encourage other police departments as well.","mm_name":"SR","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"}},{"SR":{"author":"Soulskill","title":"Serious Economic Crisis Looms In Russia, China May Help\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t265","location":"http://news.slashdot.org/story/14/12/23/209254/serious-economic-crisis-looms-in-russia-china-may-help","description":"Russia is facing a \"full-blown economic crisis,\" a former finance minister has warned, as the country is forced to take emergency financial measures. The economy has been battered by a wave of sanctions (set by other countries as a result of tensions over Ukraine), geopolitical uncertainty, and falling oil prices. Analysts have warned that the Russian economy will not improve in the long run until the aforementioned conditions have also improved. The Central Bank of Russia said that a plan to loan Trust bank an amount of up to 30bn rubles ($54m) had been approved. Trust bank has run a series of advertisements featuring actor Bruce Willis in Russia, along with the ironic quote: \"When I need money, I just take it.\" Anna Stupnytska, an economist at Fidelity Solutions, said that \"the risk of a sovereign default is low, it's the corporate sector where the main vulnerabilities lie, and banking in particular.

{"wikipedia_page":{"title":"Type system","description":"In programming languages, a type system is a collection of rules that assign a property called a type to the various construct—​such as variables, expressions, functions or modules—​that a computer program is composed of.[1] The main purpose of a type system is to reduce bugs in computer programs[2] by defining interfaces between different parts of a computer program, and then checking that the parts have been connected in a consistent way. This checking can happen statically (at compile time), dynamically (at run time), or it can happen as a combination of static and dynamic checking. Type systems have other purposes as well, such as enabling certain compiler optimizations, allowing for multiple dispatch, providing a form of documentation, etc.","location":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system","sections":[{"title":"Fundamentals","mm_name":"section","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Type checking","mm_name":"section","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Polymorphism and types","mm_name":"section","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Specialized type systems","mm_name":"section","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Explicit or implicit declaration and inference","mm_name":"section","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Types of types","mm_name":"section","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Unified type system","mm_name":"section","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Compatibility: equivalence and subtyping","mm_name":"section","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Programming style","mm_name":"section","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"See also","mm_name":"section","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"References","mm_name":"section","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Further reading","mm_name":"section","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"External links","mm_name":"section","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"}],"categories":[{"title":"Type systems","location":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Type_systems","mm_name":"wikipedia_category_type","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Data types","location":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Data_types","mm_name":"wikipedia_category_type","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Program analysis","location":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Program_analysis","mm_name":"wikipedia_category_type","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"},{"title":"Type theory","location":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Type_theory","mm_name":"wikipedia_category_type","download_status":"UNPROCESSED"}],"favicon":{"location":"http://bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","mm_name":"image"},"download_status":"DOWNLOAD_DONE","mm_name":"wikipedia_page"}}

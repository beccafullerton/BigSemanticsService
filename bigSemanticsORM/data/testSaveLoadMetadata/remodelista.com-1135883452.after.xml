	title="Victoria and Albert Wessex Bath"
	description="Victoria &amp; Albert bathtubs are made from ENGLISHCAST, a technology where a mineral crystal composite is cast to form a brilliant white, solid surface product. Solid, so it won&#39;t flex. There are no layers or surface coatings to chip, delaminate, creak under pressure or wear away. Victoria &amp; Albert tubs won&#39;t cool hot water quickly, as cast iron does. ENGLISHCAST has insulating properties to keep you warmer longer."
